	Abstract = {Stratification is the exposure of seeds to conditions which break dormancy and enhance germination. Currently stratification is limited to abiotic conditions such as cold, acidity, light, salinity and osmotic priming. Here, the role of biological stratification on mycovitality was uncovered by assessing the effect of fungal endosymbiont on its host plant during dormancy release and germination commencement in seeds. The impact of the endophytic fungal SMCD 2206 strain on germination energy and vigor as compared to untreated seeds was evaluated. The expression patterns of plant growth promoting genes, repression of shoot growth (RSG) protein and ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO) of gibberellins (GAs), during the early breakage of seed dormancy and germination were assessed and indicated the involvement of a GA-mediated negative feedback regulation in treated seeds. The GA levels in all treated seeds reached optimum before 24 h of germination with direct interactions between seeds and endophyte generating maximum GA levels during the early germination stage. Our findings bring a significant contribution to plant prenatal care of cereal crops; they demonstrate endophyte-mediated vitality, a reprogramming of pre- and post-germination events in wheat seeds, which enhances dormancy breakage and germination.},

@article{Tahaei2016,
	Abstract = {Reduced seed germination is among the most important factors adversely affecting crop stand and subsequent plant growth. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill) is an important medicinal plant with poor seed germination rate, occasionally. It is accordingly pertinent to find methods which can enhance fennel seed germination and remove the barriers of dormancy breaking. The present experiments studied the effects of two different priming (cold moist stratification and osmopriming) and 14 dormancy breaking techniques (hormonal, osmopriming, biopriming, chemical priming, and hydropriming) on the seed germination and seedling growth of two different fennel genotypes under growth chamber conditions. In the first and second experiment, the priming techniques including the time lengths of cold moist stratification (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) and the concentrations of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000, osmopriming at −0.99, −1.35, and −2.33 MPa) were used as the main plots. However, in both experiments, the dormancy breaking techniques and fennel genotypes were factorially combined and used as the subplots. Different seed- and seedling-related parameters including germination ({\%}), plumule, radicle and seedling length, average germination time, rate and homogeneity of germination, and seed vigor index were determined. Both priming techniques were efficient on the enhancement of seed germination and seedling growth. Among the dormancy breaking techniques, Aminol Forte (biopriming), kadostim (biopriming), benzyl adenine{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}kinetin (biopriming), distilled water (hydropriming), gibberellin{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}kinetin (hormonal priming), and benzyl adenine{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}kinetin{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}gibberellin (biopriming) were the most effective ones. The related concentrations were equal to 100 mg/l, 10−5 M, and 0.4 {\%}. The fennel genotypes reacted significantly different under priming conditions. It is possible to enhance seed germination and seedling growth of fennel using priming and dormancy breaking techniques, which is useful for the increased production of fennel under different conditions. The results indicate that bio and hydropriming techniques were among the most effective ones, which significantly increased seed germination and seedling growth, and removed the seed dormancy barriers.},

@article{Daneshvar2016,
	Abstract = {Dormancy in Juniperus polycarpos (K. Koch) seeds is a major hurdle for production of the desired quantity of seedlings in nurseries for restoration purpose. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an optimal dormancy breaking treatment and subsequent stimulation of germination. The treatments applied were cold stratification at 1 {\textdegree}C for 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks; warm stratification at 20 {\textdegree}C for 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks followed by 12 weeks of cold stratification; exogenous application of 250, 500, and 1000 ppm gibberellic acid (GA3) and 6-Benzylamino purine (BAP); and a combination of 500 ppm hormones and cold stratification. The results show significant differences in germination between cold and warm-cold stratification, length of stratification and their interaction (p < 0.01). Warm stratification for 16 weeks followed by 12 weeks of cold stratification induced 72 {\%} of the seeds to germination in 12 days compared with 16-week cold-stratification alone (42 {\%}) and the control (8 {\%}). Exogenous application of GA3 and BAP alone or in combination with cold stratification resulted in less than 50 {\%} germination though significantly (p < 0.01) higher than the control. Apparently, the hormone treatments alone or in combination with cold stratification are not effective in completely breaking dormancy and stimulation of germination. The findings suggest that J. polycarpos seeds may possess intermediate simple morpho-physiological dormancy, which could be an adaptive mechanism for relatively warmer autumn temperature during seed maturation and the subsequent cold winter temperature under natural conditions.},

@article{Porceddu2017,
	Abstract = {Abstract Threshold‐based thermal time models provide insight into the physiological switch from the dormant to the non‐dormant germinating seed. This approach was used to quantify the different growth responses of the embryo of seeds purported to have morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) through the complex phases of dormancy release and germination. Aquilegia barbaricina seeds were incubated at constant temperatures (10--25 $\,^{\circ}$C) and 25/10 $\,^{\circ}$C, without pre‐treatment, after warm+cold stratification (W+C) and GA3 treatment. Embryo growth was assessed and the time of testa and endosperm rupture scored. Base temperatures (Tb) and thermal times for 50\% (θ50) of embryo growth and seed germination were calculated. W+C enabled slow embryo growth. W+C and GA3 promoted rapid embryo growth and subsequent radicle emergence. The embryo internal growth base temperature (Tbe) was ca. 5 $\,^{\circ}$C for W+C and GA3‐treated seeds. GA3 treatment also resulted in similar Tb estimates for radicle emergence. The thermal times for embryo growth (θe50) and germination (θg50) were four‐ to six‐fold longer in the presence of GA3 compared to W+C. A. barbaricina is characterised by a multi‐step seed germination. The slow embryo growth during W+C reflects continuation of the maternal programme of development, whilst the thermal kinetics of both embryo and radicle growth after the removal of physiological dormancy are distinctly different. The effects of W+C on the multiphasic germination response in MPD seeds are only partially mimicked by 250 mg·l−1 GA3. The thermal time approach could be a valid tool to model thermal kinetics of embryo growth and radicle protrusion.},

	Abstract = {Summary Local differences in climate conditions may facilitate rapid evolutionary changes in introduced plants to optimize timing of germination or ability to survive in seed banks, which may constitute beneficial demographic adaptations during range expansions. Understanding differences in germination requirements and emergence patterns across a species' range is critical for demographic modelling and potential invasive species control efforts. We assessed germination responses of Alliaria petiolata using seeds collected from 10 populations spanning much of the North American distribution of the species. We compared germination responses under different stratification regimes in a growth chamber over 2·5 years, and evaluated seedling emergence in a common garden in Ithaca, New York over 13 years. We further evaluated how climate overlap between Ithaca and original collection sites influenced emergence patterns. In the laboratory, germination of all populations was similar and highest at 4 $\,^{\circ}$C stratification. Seeds exposed to sub‐zero temperatures delayed germination and population responses were variable. In the common garden, seedlings from most populations emerged over 13 years, and emergence patterns were strongly influenced by population. Annual emergence was positively correlated with spring temperature and inversely correlated with number of spring days with minimum temperature below freezing. Climate overlap between the common garden and original collection location enhanced germination, but common garden climate conditions over the course of the 13‐year experiment and population identity had greater explanatory power. Synthesis. Laboratory germination tests did not reflect seedling emergence under field conditions. After 150 years of residence time in North America, Alliaria petiolata populations have developed striking differences in their responses to local climates and stratification requirements suggesting that a complex interplay of pre‐adaptation, rapid evolutionary changes, and phenotypic plasticity result in locally adapted populations.},

@article{Seglias:2018aa,
	Abstract = {For many species and seed sources used in restoration activities, specific seed germination requirements are often unknown. Because seed dormancy and germination traits can be constrained by phylogenetic history, related species are often assumed to have similar traits. However, significant variation in these traits is also present within species as a result of adaptation to local climatic conditions. A growing number of studies have attempted to disentangle how phylogeny and climate influence seed dormancy and germination traits, but they have focused primarily on species-level effects, ignoring potential population-level variation. We examined the relationships between phylogeny, climate, and seed dormancy and germination traits for 24 populations of eight native, restoration-relevant forb species found in a wide range of climatic conditions in the Southwest United States. The seeds were exposed to eight temperature and stratification length regimes designed to mimic regional climatic conditions. Phylogenetic relatedness, overall climatic conditions, and temperature conditions at the site were all significantly correlated with final germination response, with significant among-population variation in germination response across incubation treatments for seven of our eight study species. Notably, germination during stratification was significantly predicted by precipitation seasonality and differed significantly among populations for seven species. While previous studies have not examined germination during stratification as a potential trait influencing overall germination response, our results suggest that this trait should be included in germination studies as well as seed sourcing decisions. Results of this study deepen our understanding of the relationships between source climate, species identity, and germination, leading to improved seed sourcing decisions for restorations.},

	Abstract = {Despite the strong environmental control of seed dormancy and longevity, their changes along latitudes are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to assess seed dormancy and longevity in different populations across the distribution of the arctic--alpine plant Silene suecica. Seeds of seven populations collected from alpine (Spain, Italy, Scotland) and subarctic (Sweden, Norway) populations were incubated at four temperature regimes and five cold stratification intervals for germination and dormancy testing. Seed longevity was studied by exposing seeds to controlled ageing (45 {\textdegree}C, 60{\%} RH) and regularly sampled for germination. Fresh seeds of S. suecica germinated at warm temperature (20/15 {\textdegree}C) and more in subarctic (80--100{\%}) compared to alpine (20--50{\%}) populations showed a negative correlation with autumn temperature (i.e., post-dispersal period). Seed germination increased after cold stratification in all populations, with different percentages (30--100{\%}). Similarly, there was a large variation of seed longevity (p50 = 12--32 days), with seeds from the wettest locations showing faster deterioration rate. Subarctic populations of S. suecica were less dormant, showing a warmer suitable temperature range for germination, and a higher germinability than alpine populations. Germination and dormancy were driven by an interplay of geographical and climatic factors, with alpine and warm versus subarctic and cool autumn conditions, eliciting a decrease and an increase of emergence, respectively. Germination and dormancy patterns typically found in alpine habitats may not be found in the arctic.},
