	Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of seed
   stratification on germination rate, germination speed, and initial
   development of seedlings of six pecan (Carya illinoinensis) cultivars
   under subtropical climatic conditions in southern Brazil. For
   stratification, the seeds were placed in boxes with moist sand, in a
   cold chamber at 4 degrees C, for 90 days. In the fourteenth week after
   sowing, the emergence speed index, total emergence, plant height, stem
   diameter, and number of leaves were evaluated. Seed stratification
   significantly improves the germination potential and morphological
   traits of the evaluated cultivars.}},

@article{Liu2016,
	Abstract = {{Background: Seeds use environmental cues such as temperature to
   coordinate the timing of their germination, allowing plants to
   synchronize their life history with the seasons. Winter chilling is of
   central importance to alleviate seed dormancy, but very little is known
   of how chilling responses are regulated in conifer seeds. White spruce
   (Picea glauca) is an important conifer species of boreal forests in the
   North American taiga. The recent sequencing and assembly of the white
   spruce genome allows for comparative gene expression studies toward
   elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing dormancy alleviation by
   moist chilling. Here we focused on hormone metabolite profiling and
   analyses of genes encoding components of hormone signal transduction
   pathways, to elucidate changes during dormancy alleviation and to help
   address how germination cues such as temperature and light trigger
   radicle emergence.
   Results: ABA, GA, and auxin underwent considerable changes as seeds
   underwent moist chilling and during subsequent germination; likewise,
   transcripts encoding hormone-signaling components (e.g. ABI3, ARF4 and
   Aux/IAA) were differentially regulated during these critical stages.
   During moist chilling, active IAA was maintained at constant levels, but
   IAA conjugates (IAA-Asp and IAA-Glu) were substantially accumulated. ABA
   concentrations decreased during germination of previously moist-chilled
   seeds, while the precursor of bioactive GA1 (GA53) accumulated. We
   contend that seed dormancy and germination may be partly mediated
   through the changing hormone concentrations and a modulation of
   interactions between central auxin-signaling pathway components
   (TIR1/AFB, Aux/IAA and ARF4). In response to germination cues, namely
   exposure to light and to increased temperature: the transfer of seeds
   from moist-chilling to 30 degrees C, significant changes in gene
   transcripts and protein expression occurred during the first six hours,
   substantiating a very swift reaction to germination-promoting conditions
   after seeds had received sufficient exposure to the chilling stimulus.
   Conclusions: The dormancy to germination transition in white spruce
   seeds was correlated with changes in auxin conjugation, auxin signaling
   components, and potential interactions between auxin-ABA signaling
   cascades (e.g. the transcription factor ARF4 and ABI3). Auxin flux adds
   a new dimension to the ABA: GA balance mechanism that underlies both
   dormancy alleviation by chilling, and subsequent radicle emergence to
   complete germination by warm temperature and light stimuli.}},

	Abstract = {{Daphne giraldii Nitsche (Thymelaeaceae) is a perennial evergreen shrub
   that is widely used in the ornamental plant and pharmaceutical
   industries in China. It exhibits dormancy, which delays and reduces
   germination. This study determined the, effects of chemical treatment,
   stratification and burial treatment for overcoming the seed dormancy of
   D. giraldii. Results showed that chemical pre-treatment was less
   effective in breaking dormancy. The best germination percentage (G(P))
   was 52.33 \%, a germination rate (G(R)) of 1.19 only observed after 70 d
   of seed stratification at 5 degrees C treatment, indicating that the
   germination behavior of D. giraldii was not significantly affected by
   stratification. The physiological dormancy of D. giraldii seeds was
   alleviated during burial. Seeds buried at 100 cm depth for 170 days
   showed the highest germination success with G(P) of 86.5 \% and G(R) of
   10.11, which was the most effective treatment to alleviate seed
   dormancy. This information may be useful to restore and conserve other
   shrubs grown in Northwestern China and elucidate their survival under

	Abstract = {Seed dormancy is an adaptive trait that widely exists in angiosperms and gymnosperms. The mechanisms for the release of seed dormancy have been less well studied. Using smoke tree (Cotinus coggygria var. Cinerea Engler) seeds, the effect of cold moist stratification (5 {\textdegree}C, 18.5 {\%} humidity and 0--75 days) on dormancy release, changes of respiration rate, ABA and GA3 content, and the differentially expressed proteins during dormancy release were investigated. Seed dormancy was released during cold moist stratification, seed respiration rate was increased while both ABA and GA3 concentrations were decreased. A total of 28 protein spots with significant changes in relative expression abundance were detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Among these protein spots, four proteins of ATPase $\beta$ subunit, heat-shock cognate protein 70, aspartic proteinase 1 and actin were successfully identified by the matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. These four proteins were all down-expressed during dormancy release, and their possible implications for dormancy release of C. coggygria seeds was discussed. A better understanding of seed dormancy release and germination has practical benefits to seedling production for forest regeneration purposes.},

	Abstract = {{Seed germination experiments with Corylopsis coreana, C. sinensis var.
   calvescens, and Corylopsis gotoana were conducted. Corylopsis coreana
   seeds were treated at 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 20 degrees C to study the
   upper temperature limit to break dormancy. Seeds of C. sinensis var.
   calvescens were treated 1 month with warm stratification (WS) at 10, 15,
   20, and 25 degrees C followed by cold stratification (CS) at 5 degrees C
   for 0, 1, 2, and 3 months to understand the requirements of WS and CS to
   effectively break dormancy. Germination of Corylopsis seeds at 15-20
   degrees C without CS suggests that dormancy is considered shallow and
   the upper temperature limit to break is 12.5 degrees C. Immersing seeds
   in water or ethanol induced seed germination which may result from
   leaching of inhibitors from the seed. Observation of seed coats
   following treatment with water and ethanol by means of low temperature
   scanning electron microscopy (LT-SEM) revealed elongated and
   rectangular/hexagonal shaped cells in C. coreana and irregular jigsaw
   puzzle-piece shapes in C. gotoana. In conclusion, dormancy in Corylopsis

In addition, we investigated how the different parts of the seed contributed to dormancy and intraspecific variability. S. phleoides has non-deep physiological dormancy that appeared to be related to its testa. Thereby, dormancy was completely removed with puncturing treatments. High levels of germination were also obtained in seeds stratified at 8$\,^{\circ}$C over 100 days in a solution of nitrates. After-ripening treatment did not have a significant effect in breaking dormancy. Similar germination behaviour and dormancy levels were observed in the different populations, especially when they were subjected to cold stratification. Although further work is needed, cold stratification appears to be the major factor in determining the time of seedling establishment in natural environments for this species.},

	Abstract = {{Some Rubus species are slow to germinate due to their thick, impermeable
   endocarp and physiological dormancy. We studied the effect of
   scarification and stratification on the breaking of dormancy in five
   Rubus species (R. parvifolius, R. phoenicolasius, R. buergeri, R.
   takesimensis and R. corchorifolius). On anatomical observation, Rubus
   stones are generally shown to have a three-layered endocarp (outer-,
   middle-, and inner-endocarp) that conveys physical dormancy. For the
   scarification treatment, stones were treated with sulphuric acid. The
   most effective treatment for breaking dormancy resulted in 50-70\%
   scarification of the middle-endocarp. The combined treatment of
   scarification and stratification considerably increased germination of
   Rubus seeds. In particular, sulphuric acid scarification followed by
   cold stratification (eight weeks at 4 degrees C) was most effective for
   three species: R. parvifolius, R. phoenicolasius and R. takesimensis.
   However, R. corchorifolius showed very similar results in all
   stratification treatments and R. buergeri was affected by neither single
   nor combined scarification and stratification treatments. In summary,
   three of the studied species of Rubus were found to exhibit deep
   combinational dormancy caused by a hard endocarp and physiological
   inhibitory mechanisms. In contrast, R. corchorifolius seeds only showed
   physical dormancy.}},

	Abstract = {{In this study, three putative plant growth promoting rhizobacteria
   (PGPR) including Pseudomonas putida strain 168, Bacillus subtilis strain
   FzB24 and Enterobacter cloacae strain 12, were applied as single and
   combination of three strains for their ability to improve seed
   germination traits and early growth in three Corylus avellana ecotypes.
   After inclusion, seeds were sown in 45 cmx20 cmx10 cm plastic containers
   filled with wet sterilized river sand and subjected to cold
   stratification (CS) in a refrigerator at (5 +/- 1 degrees C) for 0, 3
   and 4 months. The experiment was done based on factorial in a completely
   randomized design with 3 replicates of 20 seeds each. The numbers of
   germinated seeds were recorded daily for each ecotype. At the end of the
   experiment, germination percentage (GP), germination speed (GS), seed
   vigor index (SVI) of the seeds were calculated. Results showed that, CS,
   ecotypes, bacteria inoculation and interactions of these factors
   affected germination traits. Over all treatments, GP ranged from 1.66\%
   to 65.40\% among the ecotypes. Both CS and inoculation had positive
   effect on GP. The greatest GP (61.35-65.40\%) and onset of germination
   occurred in seeds co-inoculated by the combination of 3 bacterial
   inoculants followed by 4 months CS. Among ecotypes, the highest SVI
   (160.77) belonged to seeds of Makesh ecotype inoculated by the
   combination of 3 bacterial inoculants full in some points owed by 4
   months CS. In case of application of bacterial as individual, the
   highest germination traits and early growth were obtained in seeds
   inoculated with Pseudomonas putida. The findings confirm that PGPR is
   better to be used in combination with cold stratification to overcome
   seed dormancy, improvement of seed germination treats and early growth
   of C. avellana.}},

	Abstract = {Stratification is the exposure of seeds to conditions which break dormancy and enhance germination. Currently stratification is limited to abiotic conditions such as cold, acidity, light, salinity and osmotic priming. Here, the role of biological stratification on mycovitality was uncovered by assessing the effect of fungal endosymbiont on its host plant during dormancy release and germination commencement in seeds. The impact of the endophytic fungal SMCD 2206 strain on germination energy and vigor as compared to untreated seeds was evaluated. The expression patterns of plant growth promoting genes, repression of shoot growth (RSG) protein and ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO) of gibberellins (GAs), during the early breakage of seed dormancy and germination were assessed and indicated the involvement of a GA-mediated negative feedback regulation in treated seeds. The GA levels in all treated seeds reached optimum before 24 h of germination with direct interactions between seeds and endophyte generating maximum GA levels during the early germination stage. Our findings bring a significant contribution to plant prenatal care of cereal crops; they demonstrate endophyte-mediated vitality, a reprogramming of pre- and post-germination events in wheat seeds, which enhances dormancy breakage and germination.},

	Abstract = {Reduced seed germination is among the most important factors adversely affecting crop stand and subsequent plant growth. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill) is an important medicinal plant with poor seed germination rate, occasionally. It is accordingly pertinent to find methods which can enhance fennel seed germination and remove the barriers of dormancy breaking. The present experiments studied the effects of two different priming (cold moist stratification and osmopriming) and 14 dormancy breaking techniques (hormonal, osmopriming, biopriming, chemical priming, and hydropriming) on the seed germination and seedling growth of two different fennel genotypes under growth chamber conditions. In the first and second experiment, the priming techniques including the time lengths of cold moist stratification (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) and the concentrations of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000, osmopriming at −0.99, −1.35, and −2.33 MPa) were used as the main plots. However, in both experiments, the dormancy breaking techniques and fennel genotypes were factorially combined and used as the subplots. Different seed- and seedling-related parameters including germination ({\%}), plumule, radicle and seedling length, average germination time, rate and homogeneity of germination, and seed vigor index were determined. Both priming techniques were efficient on the enhancement of seed germination and seedling growth. Among the dormancy breaking techniques, Aminol Forte (biopriming), kadostim (biopriming), benzyl adenine{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}kinetin (biopriming), distilled water (hydropriming), gibberellin{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}kinetin (hormonal priming), and benzyl adenine{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}kinetin{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}gibberellin (biopriming) were the most effective ones. The related concentrations were equal to 100 mg/l, 10−5 M, and 0.4 {\%}. The fennel genotypes reacted significantly different under priming conditions. It is possible to enhance seed germination and seedling growth of fennel using priming and dormancy breaking techniques, which is useful for the increased production of fennel under different conditions. The results indicate that bio and hydropriming techniques were among the most effective ones, which significantly increased seed germination and seedling growth, and removed the seed dormancy barriers.},

@article{Daneshvar2016,
	Abstract = {Dormancy in Juniperus polycarpos (K. Koch) seeds is a major hurdle for production of the desired quantity of seedlings in nurseries for restoration purpose. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an optimal dormancy breaking treatment and subsequent stimulation of germination. The treatments applied were cold stratification at 1 {\textdegree}C for 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks; warm stratification at 20 {\textdegree}C for 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks followed by 12 weeks of cold stratification; exogenous application of 250, 500, and 1000 ppm gibberellic acid (GA3) and 6-Benzylamino purine (BAP); and a combination of 500 ppm hormones and cold stratification. The results show significant differences in germination between cold and warm-cold stratification, length of stratification and their interaction (p < 0.01). Warm stratification for 16 weeks followed by 12 weeks of cold stratification induced 72 {\%} of the seeds to germination in 12 days compared with 16-week cold-stratification alone (42 {\%}) and the control (8 {\%}). Exogenous application of GA3 and BAP alone or in combination with cold stratification resulted in less than 50 {\%} germination though significantly (p < 0.01) higher than the control. Apparently, the hormone treatments alone or in combination with cold stratification are not effective in completely breaking dormancy and stimulation of germination. The findings suggest that J. polycarpos seeds may possess intermediate simple morpho-physiological dormancy, which could be an adaptive mechanism for relatively warmer autumn temperature during seed maturation and the subsequent cold winter temperature under natural conditions.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Threshold‐based thermal time models provide insight into the physiological switch from the dormant to the non‐dormant germinating seed. This approach was used to quantify the different growth responses of the embryo of seeds purported to have morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) through the complex phases of dormancy release and germination. Aquilegia barbaricina seeds were incubated at constant temperatures (10--25 $\,^{\circ}$C) and 25/10 $\,^{\circ}$C, without pre‐treatment, after warm+cold stratification (W+C) and GA3 treatment. Embryo growth was assessed and the time of testa and endosperm rupture scored. Base temperatures (Tb) and thermal times for 50\% (θ50) of embryo growth and seed germination were calculated. W+C enabled slow embryo growth. W+C and GA3 promoted rapid embryo growth and subsequent radicle emergence. The embryo internal growth base temperature (Tbe) was ca. 5 $\,^{\circ}$C for W+C and GA3‐treated seeds. GA3 treatment also resulted in similar Tb estimates for radicle emergence. The thermal times for embryo growth (θe50) and germination (θg50) were four‐ to six‐fold longer in the presence of GA3 compared to W+C. A. barbaricina is characterised by a multi‐step seed germination. The slow embryo growth during W+C reflects continuation of the maternal programme of development, whilst the thermal kinetics of both embryo and radicle growth after the removal of physiological dormancy are distinctly different. The effects of W+C on the multiphasic germination response in MPD seeds are only partially mimicked by 250 mg·l−1 GA3. The thermal time approach could be a valid tool to model thermal kinetics of embryo growth and radicle protrusion.},

	Abstract = {Summary Local differences in climate conditions may facilitate rapid evolutionary changes in introduced plants to optimize timing of germination or ability to survive in seed banks, which may constitute beneficial demographic adaptations during range expansions. Understanding differences in germination requirements and emergence patterns across a species' range is critical for demographic modelling and potential invasive species control efforts. We assessed germination responses of Alliaria petiolata using seeds collected from 10 populations spanning much of the North American distribution of the species. We compared germination responses under different stratification regimes in a growth chamber over 2·5 years, and evaluated seedling emergence in a common garden in Ithaca, New York over 13 years. We further evaluated how climate overlap between Ithaca and original collection sites influenced emergence patterns. In the laboratory, germination of all populations was similar and highest at 4 $\,^{\circ}$C stratification. Seeds exposed to sub‐zero temperatures delayed germination and population responses were variable. In the common garden, seedlings from most populations emerged over 13 years, and emergence patterns were strongly influenced by population. Annual emergence was positively correlated with spring temperature and inversely correlated with number of spring days with minimum temperature below freezing. Climate overlap between the common garden and original collection location enhanced germination, but common garden climate conditions over the course of the 13‐year experiment and population identity had greater explanatory power. Synthesis. Laboratory germination tests did not reflect seedling emergence under field conditions. After 150 years of residence time in North America, Alliaria petiolata populations have developed striking differences in their responses to local climates and stratification requirements suggesting that a complex interplay of pre‐adaptation, rapid evolutionary changes, and phenotypic plasticity result in locally adapted populations.},

@article{Seglias:2018aa,
	Abstract = {For many species and seed sources used in restoration activities, specific seed germination requirements are often unknown. Because seed dormancy and germination traits can be constrained by phylogenetic history, related species are often assumed to have similar traits. However, significant variation in these traits is also present within species as a result of adaptation to local climatic conditions. A growing number of studies have attempted to disentangle how phylogeny and climate influence seed dormancy and germination traits, but they have focused primarily on species-level effects, ignoring potential population-level variation. We examined the relationships between phylogeny, climate, and seed dormancy and germination traits for 24 populations of eight native, restoration-relevant forb species found in a wide range of climatic conditions in the Southwest United States. The seeds were exposed to eight temperature and stratification length regimes designed to mimic regional climatic conditions. Phylogenetic relatedness, overall climatic conditions, and temperature conditions at the site were all significantly correlated with final germination response, with significant among-population variation in germination response across incubation treatments for seven of our eight study species. Notably, germination during stratification was significantly predicted by precipitation seasonality and differed significantly among populations for seven species. While previous studies have not examined germination during stratification as a potential trait influencing overall germination response, our results suggest that this trait should be included in germination studies as well as seed sourcing decisions. Results of this study deepen our understanding of the relationships between source climate, species identity, and germination, leading to improved seed sourcing decisions for restorations.},

	Abstract = {Despite the strong environmental control of seed dormancy and longevity, their changes along latitudes are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to assess seed dormancy and longevity in different populations across the distribution of the arctic--alpine plant Silene suecica. Seeds of seven populations collected from alpine (Spain, Italy, Scotland) and subarctic (Sweden, Norway) populations were incubated at four temperature regimes and five cold stratification intervals for germination and dormancy testing. Seed longevity was studied by exposing seeds to controlled ageing (45 {\textdegree}C, 60{\%} RH) and regularly sampled for germination. Fresh seeds of S. suecica germinated at warm temperature (20/15 {\textdegree}C) and more in subarctic (80--100{\%}) compared to alpine (20--50{\%}) populations showed a negative correlation with autumn temperature (i.e., post-dispersal period). Seed germination increased after cold stratification in all populations, with different percentages (30--100{\%}). Similarly, there was a large variation of seed longevity (p50 = 12--32 days), with seeds from the wettest locations showing faster deterioration rate. Subarctic populations of S. suecica were less dormant, showing a warmer suitable temperature range for germination, and a higher germinability than alpine populations. Germination and dormancy were driven by an interplay of geographical and climatic factors, with alpine and warm versus subarctic and cool autumn conditions, eliciting a decrease and an increase of emergence, respectively. Germination and dormancy patterns typically found in alpine habitats may not be found in the arctic.},
