@article{Mondoni2012a,
	Abstract = {{We examined the germination ecology and the temperature requirements for
   germination of Erythronium dens-canis, under both outdoor and laboratory
   conditions. E. dens-canis is a spring flowering woodland geophyte widely
   distributed across Europe. Germination phenology, including embryo
   development and radicle and cotyledon emergence, were investigated in a
   natural population growing in Northern Italy. Immediately after harvest,
   seeds of E.similar to dens-canis were either sown on agar in the
   laboratory under simulated seasonal temperatures or placed in nylon mesh
   sachets and buried in the wild. Embryos, undifferentiated at the time of
   seed dispersal, grew during summer and autumn conditions in the
   laboratory and in the wild, culminating in radicle emergence in winter
   when temperatures fell to similar to 5 degrees C. Emergence of
   cotyledons did not occur immediately after radicle emergence, but was
   delayed until the end of winter. Laboratory experiments showed that
   temperature is the main factor controlling dormancy and germination,
   with seeds becoming non-dormant only when given warmth, followed by cold
   stratification. Unlike seeds of E.similar to dens-canis that germinate
   in winter, in other Erythronium species radicle emergence occurs in
   autumn, while in some it is delayed until seeds are transferred from
   winter to spring conditions. Our results suggest that there is genetic
   and environmental control of the expression of seed dormancy amongst
   Erythronium species, which is related to local climate.}},

@article{Castro-Colina2012,
	Abstract = {{To facilitate restoration of the lava field forests surrounding Mexico
   City, we developed methods to improve the germination and field seedling
   performance of Quercus rugosa using hydropriming (regulated hydration of
   seeds in water), and we used special watering regimes to improve
   seedling acclimation. The size, dry mass, fresh mass and water content
   of seeds were measured, and curves were generated to evaluate acorn
   hydration and dehydration. The effects of stratification (5A degrees C),
   heat shock (50A degrees C) and scarification on germination were tested.
   All treated seeds and controls were germinated in control chambers at
   21A degrees C. One hydropriming cycle (PC) consisted of two hydration
   days followed by two dehydration days; treatments of 1, 2 and 3 PCs were
   tested. Seedlings from 1PC to 2PC were acclimated in a shade house under
   high and low watering regimes (400 and 200 mL week(-1), respectively).
   In the shade house and field, the effects of hydropriming and watering
   treatments were evaluated by measuring length, basal diameter, crown
   cover, number of leaves and branches and leaf area of seedlings. Dry and
   fresh mass were used to calculate acorn water content. Dehydration and
   hydration curves displayed hysteresis. Acorns exhibited physiological
   dormancy, which could be overcome by stratification or by 1 month of
   storage. 1PC led to increased germination rates and final germination.
   In both the shade house and field, 1PC showed a positive effect on all
   seedling growth parameters except branch number. Field survival was not
   affected. Generally, 1PC favoured efficient seed germination, seedling
   vigour and homogenous plant production.}},

@article{Qu2012,
	Abstract = {{Seeds with a water-impermeable seed coat and a physiologically dormant
   embryo are classified as having combinational dormancy. Seeds of Sicyos
   angulatus (burcucumber) have been clearly shown to have a
   water-impermeable seed coat (physical dormancy {[}PY]). The primary aim
   of the present study was to confirm (or not) that physiological dormancy
   (PD) is also present in seeds of S. angulatus. The highest germination
   of scarified fresh (38\%) and 3-month dry-stored (36\%) seeds occurred
   at 35/20 degrees C. The rate (speed) of germination was faster in
   scarified dry-stored seeds than in scarified fresh seeds. Removal of the
   seed coat, but leaving the membrane surrounding the embryo intact,
   increased germination of both fresh and dry-stored seeds to > 85\% at
   35/20 degrees C. Germination (80100\%) of excised embryos (both seed
   coat and membrane removed) occurred at 15/6, 25/15 and 35/20 degrees C
   and reached 95100\% after 4 days of incubation at 25/15 and 35/20
   degrees C. Dry storage (after-ripening) caused an increase in the
   germination percentage of scarified and of decoated seeds at 25/15
   degrees C and in both germination percentage and rate of excised embryos
   at 15/6 degrees C. Eight weeks of cold stratification resulted in a
   significant increase in the germination of scarified seeds at 25/15 and
   35/20 degrees C and of decoated seeds at 15/6 and 25/15 degrees C. Based
   on the results of our study and on information reported in the
   literature, we conclude that seeds of S. angulatus not only have PY, but
   also non-deep PD, that is, combinational dormancy (PY + PD).}},

@article{Hidayati2012,
	Abstract = {{Several ecologically important plant families in Mediterranean biomes
   have seeds with morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) but have been poorly
   studied. The aim of this study was to understand the seed ecology of
   these species by focusing on the prominent, yet intractably dormant
   Australian genus Hibbertia. It was hypothesized that the slow
   germination in species of this genus is caused by a requirement for
   embryo growth inside the seed before germination, and that initiation of
   embryo growth is reliant upon a complex sequence of environmental cues
   including seasonal fluctuations in temperature and moisture, and an
   interplay with light and smoke. Using the results, the classification of
   the MPD level in species of Hibbertia is considered.
   Four species of Hibbertia in winter rainfall south-western Australia
   were selected. These species, whilst differing in geographic
   distributions, are variously sympatric, and all are important
   understorey components of plant communities. The following aspects
   related to dormancy break, embryo growth and germination were
   investigated: temperature and moisture requirements; effects of
   karrikinolide, gibberellic acid and aerosol smoke; and phenology.
   Following exposure to wet/dry cycles at low or high temperatures, embryo
   growth and germination occurred, albeit slowly in all species at low
   temperatures when moisture was unlimited, corresponding to winter in
   south-west Australia. Photo regime influenced germination only in H.
   racemosa. Aerosol smoke triggered substantial germination during the 1st
   germination season in H. huegelii and H. hypericoides.
   Although the study species are con-generic, sympatric and produce seeds
   of identical morphology, they possessed different dormancy-break and
   germination requirements. The physiological component of MPD was
   non-deep in H. racemosa but varied in the other three species where more
   deeply dormant seeds required 1 summer to overcome dormancy and, thus,
   germination was spread over time. Embryos grew during winter, but future
   studies need to resolve the role of cold versus warm stratification by
   using constant temperature regimes. To include Mediterranean species
   with MPD, some modifications to the current seed-dormancy classification
   system may need consideration: (a) wet/dry conditions for warm
   stratification and (b) a relatively long period for warm stratification.
   These outcomes have important implications for improving experimental
   approaches to resolve the effective use of broadcast seed for ecological
   restoration.}},

@article{Mondoni2012,
	Abstract = {{Despite the considerable number of studies on the impacts of climate
   change on alpine plants, there have been few attempts to investigate its
   effect on regeneration. Recruitment from seeds is a key event in the
   life-history of plants, affecting their spread and evolution and
   seasonal changes in climate will inevitably affect recruitment success.
   Here, an investigation was made of how climate change will affect the
   timing and the level of germination in eight alpine species of the
   glacier foreland.
   Using a novel approach which considered the altitudinal variation of
   temperature as a surrogate for future climate scenarios, seeds were
   exposed to 12 different cycles of simulated seasonal temperatures in the
   laboratory, derived from measurements at the soil surface at the study
   site.
   Under present climatic conditions, germination occurred in spring, in
   all but one species, after seeds had experienced autumn and winter
   seasons. However, autumn warming resulted in a significant increase in
   germination in all but two species. In contrast, seed germination was
   less sensitive to changes in spring and/or winter temperatures, which
   affected only three species.
   Climate warming will lead to a shift from spring to autumn emergence but
   the extent of this change across species will be driven by seed dormancy
   status. Ungerminated seeds at the end of autumn will be exposed to
   shorter winter seasons and lower spring temperatures in a future, warmer
   climate, but these changes will only have a minor impact on germination.
   The extent to which climate change will be detrimental to regeneration
   from seed is less likely to be due to a significant negative effect on
   germination per se, but rather to seedling emergence in seasons that the
   species are not adapted to experience. Emergence in autumn could have
   major implications for species currently adapted to emerge in spring.}},

   the germination and emergence of these fig seeds. The highest
   percentages of germination and emergence were obtained with GA(3) at 500
   or 1000 ppm for both cultivars. The seed germination and emergence of
   the cultivar `Bursa Siyahi' were higher than observed with the
   `Sarilop'. The application of GA(3) at 500 ppm or 1000 ppm reduced the
   time to germination and emergence from the seeds of both cultivars. In
   summary, the GA, treatments showed efficacy to overcome the dormancy of

	Abstract = {{Cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus L.) has attracted attention because
   of many different usage such as fresh fruit production and processing
   material for medicinal and pharmacy industry. This study was carried out
   to obtain protocols for embryo culture of cherry laurel (Prunus
   laurocerasus L.). Cherry and black types of cherry laurel embryos were
   cultured on MS media. This study was organized in two stages. In the
   first experiment the effects of the hormone combinations BAP (1.0, 2.0,
   4.0 or 6.0 mg/l) and IBA (0.5 or 1.0 mg/l) were investigated. Shoot
   formation was not observed in cherry type embryos. Shoot and root
   formation occurred from black type embryos but did not have enough
   length or quality for transfer to the acclimatization stage. Seedlings
   had rudimentary roots which did not show any growth even after their
   transfer to fresh media. The best hormone combination was 2.0+0.5 mg/l
   BAP+IBA for production of plantlets of both types. In the second
   experiment, two cold stratification times (30 or 60 clays) were applied
   to embryos. The interaction between cold stratification time and hormone
   combinations was found important. Embryo germnation rates and seedlings
   growth both increased in embryos stratified for 60 days. Embryos
   stratified for 30 days required high hormone concentration to continue
   to the next growth. Cold stratification and hormone combinations
   affected success in the growing and acclimatization stages. Embryo
   culture of cherry laurel prevented loss of material during the
   germination and shortened the time to obtain seedlings in the same
   season that the seeds were collected.}},

	Abstract = {{Sexual propagation of Prunus mahaleb is difficult due to seed dormancy.
   To overcome dormancy and maximize germination, various pretreatments
   have been applied, including stratification (warm and cold), gibberellic
   acid (GA(3)), sulfuric acid scarification (AS). and endocarp removal.
   The results show that warm stratification (WS) prior to cold
   stratification (CS) does not improve seed germination and a long period
   of WS (3 months) is disastrous for germination. CS alone (up to 4
   months) has been found to hasten and increase seed germination.
   Pretreatment of the seeds with exogenous GA(3), during the CS period,
   has been observed to result in significantly higher seed germination. AS
   of seeds for 45 minutes prior to GA(3)(1000 ppm for 24 hours) plus CS
   (up to 1 month) pretreatment has been considered to reduce the
   mechanical resistance of endocarp and improve germination. However,
   extended time of AS (180 minutes) prior to GA(3) plus CS pretreatment
   has been found to harm the seeds. The removal of endocarp has been noted
   to significantly improve germination. Seeds without endocarp, which were
   pretreated with GA(3) (1000 or 2000 ppm for 24 hours) and then cold
   stratified for 1 month, have been noted to exhibit the highest

@article{Moreira2012,
	Abstract = {{Prunus azorica is an Azorean endemic tree considered as a priority
   species for conservation. It is important as a laurel forest component,
   particularly at medium altitude, and as a food source for the endangered
   bird Pyrrhula marina. The best conditions for seed germination were
   investigated after removal of the outer layers of the fruit by
   determining the effect of 1) using stones or seeds; 2) stratification
   regime (six treatments and a control); 3) incubation temperature (four
   alternating temperature regimes); and 4) gibberellic acid concentration
   (three levels). This resulted in a fully factorial design with 168 (2 x
   7 x 4 x 3) treatments with three replicates per treatment and 25 seeds
   per replicate. Cumulative germination percentages were determined at the
   end of the trial. Globally, there was a significant effect of endocarp
   removal (49\% germination with seeds and 15\% with stones). Both for
   stones and seeds, there was a significant effect of incubation
   temperature, stratification regime, and growth regulator concentration.
   Stones attained a maximum germination of approximate to 80\% under
   several stratification treatments including cold (4 degrees C) or warm
   (20 degrees C) followed by cold and at 10/5 degrees C without the
   addition of a growth regulator. Seeds attained a maximum germination of
   greater than 90\% without stratification at 10/5 or 15/10 degrees C
   without the addition of a growth regulator. During the stratification
   process, germination occurred only for seeds, particularly for longer
   treatments, for example, those corresponding to 3 or more months of
   stratification, including warm followed by cold (75\% to 80\%) or cold
   alone (77\%). According to seed morphology and germination results, the
   seed appears to have a non-deep physiological dormancy. Seeds of P.
   azorica can thus be efficiently germinated after endocarp removal at
   temperatures of 10/5 or 15/10 degrees C with a daily light period of 12
   hours. This protocol allowed producing hundreds of viable seedlings that
   were used in the reforestation of a laurel forest stand in a LIFE

	Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to investigate the dormancy break
   and germination requirements of seeds from the rhamnaceous vine
   Berchemia scandens. The fleshy fruit contains a two-locular stone with
   an endocarp described as `bony, thickish'. Scarified and non-scarified
   stones increased by about 30-50\% in mass during imbibition over a 24-h
   period. The endocarp of the stone does not completely enclose the seeds
   and a soft tissue region is present. This region is the primary area of
   water entrance to the seed, as shown by dye-tracking and by sealing it.
   Freshly matured and overwintered seeds of B. scandens germinated to low
   percentages at all temperatures during 2 weeks of incubation in light,
   and they germinated from moderate to high percentages during 12-14 weeks
   of incubation in light. While cold stratification had a relatively
   modest effect on the promotion of total germination across most
   temperatures assessed (if seeds were left for long enough), it had a
   somewhat stronger effect on germination rate. Cold-stratified seeds
   germinated equally well in light and darkness. The class of dormancy
   found in seeds of B. scandens would be physiological. The anatomy of the
   stones readily allows water imbibition, showing that seeds of B.
   scandens lack physical dormancy, an uncommon trait in Rhamnaceae.}},

@article{Orru2012,
	Abstract = {{The importance of thermal thresholds for predicting seed dormancy
   release and germination timing under the present climate conditions and
   simulated climate change scenarios was investigated. In particular,
   Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris was investigated in four Sardinian
   populations over the full altitudinal range of the species (from approx.
   100 to 800 m a.s.l).
   Dried and fresh seeds from each population were incubated in the light
   at a range of temperatures (1025 and 25/10 C), without any pre-treatment
   and after a warm (3 months at 25 C) or a cold (3 months at 5 C)
   stratification. A thermal time approach was then applied to the
   germination results for dried seeds and the seed responses were modelled
   according to the present climate conditions and two simulated scenarios
   of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): B1 (18 C) and
   A2 (34 C).
   Cold stratification released physiological dormancy, while very few
   seeds germinated without treatments or after warm stratification. Fresh,
   cold-stratified seeds germinated significantly better (80 ) at
   temperatures epsilon 20 C than at lower temperatures. A base temperature
   for germination (T-b) of 90113 C and a thermal time requirement for 50
   of germination (THETA(50)) ranging from 336 Cd to 686 Cd were identified
   for non-dormant cold-stratified seeds, depending on the populations.
   This complex combination of thermal requirements for dormancy release
   and germination allowed prediction of field emergence from March to May
   under the present climatic conditions for the investigated populations.
   The thermal thresholds for seed germination identified in this study
   (T-b and THETA(50)) explained the differences in seed germination
   detected among populations. Under the two simulated IPCC scenarios, an
   altitude-related risk from climate warming is identified, with lowland
   populations being more threatened due to a compromised seed dormancy
   release and a narrowed seed germination window.}},

   germination and threatening plant cover in arid environment such as the
   conditions in some regions in Tunisia. Thus, the use of adapted species
   to rehabilitate these regions could be an alternative to overcome these

   the effect of salt and temperature on seed germination of the wild leek
   (A. ampeloprasum L.) from two different Tunisian islands (Kneiss \&

   and four salinity levels (0, 75, 150 \& 225 mM NaCl) were tested in a 14
   h dark: 10 h light photoperiod. The two studied populations showed a
   similar behaviour. The optimum temperature for seed germination was 15
   degrees C. Germination was inhibited by an increase in both temperature
   and salinity. Salt stress decreased both the final germination rate and
   the final germination percentage (PG\%). Delay of germination (T-0) and
   the time to half of germination (T-50) significantly (p < 0.05)
   increased in response to salt and temperature increasing. An interaction
   between salinity and temperature completely inhibited germination in 225
   mM NaCl at 30 degrees C. Seeds transferred from salt solution to
   distilled water showed a recovery percentage (R\%) varying from 0 to
   40.6 \%. Viability test showed that all non-germinated seeds were alive
   proving that A. ampeloprasum adopted a strategy of temporal inhibition
   of germination to survive under salt and temperatures increasing. As
   such it could be classified as a moderately salt tolerant species.}},

	Abstract = {{The germination of seeds and the growth of the generated plant are two
   phases of great importance in an olive breeding program. In this work,
   three stratification treatments and five cultivars (Hojiblanca,
   Manzanilla Cacerena, Manzanilla de Sevilla, Toffahi, and Uovo di
   Piccione) used as female parents in a breeding program for table olive
   were evaluated along two years to improve germination protocols. The
   stratification treatments affected seed germination (percent seeds with
   radicle), radicle length, seedling emergence (percent emerged
   hypocotyls), and the average time of emergence. The cultivars have shown
   great variability with respect to the requirements of the seeds and
   seedling growth performance. None of the treatments with heat
   application (25 degrees C) after chill (14 degrees C) improved the
   percentage of germinated seeds and seedling emergence in an year
   compared with the control treatment (30 days at 14 degrees C). Cultivars
   such as Manzanilla de Sevilla and Toffahi seem to be a good choice of
   female progenitors to improve emergence rates and to obtain early
   vigorous progenies, a character that has been related to a shorter
   juvenile period of the seedlings. Moreover, in these progenies, a clear
   lower apical dominance was found from the first stages of seedling
   growth. The olive fruit and seed traits were also influenced by the
   female parent. In fact, Hojiblanca' and `Uovo di Piccione' showed a
   higher number of empty seed fruits and double seed fruits compared with
   the other studied cultivars.}},

	Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the germination and
   development of plants from two cultivars of the peach, `Capdeboscq' and
   `Okinawa', for different periods of storage, at the commercial nursery
   of the company Frutplan Mudas Ltda., in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, from
   May to December of 2009. The kernels of both cultivars were stored in
   paper wrappings for a period of 120 days, with the following procedures
   being carried out: 10 days at room temperature + 110 days of low
   temperature, 40 days at room temperature + 80 days of low temperature,
   70 days at room temperature + 50 days of low temperature, 100 days at
   room temperature + 20 days of low temperature, and 120 days at room
   temperature, using a cold room programmed for 6 +/- 2 degrees C. The
   experiment was carried out in a randomized block design, with four
   replications and 25 seeds per plot, in a 5x2 factorial layout (two
   cultivars and five periods of stratification). The variables analyzed
   were: the percentage of seedling emergence; plant height; trunk diameter
   measured at 10 cm from the soil, speed of emergence in the field (SEF)
   and days taken to reach 70\% emergence. The emergence of cv. Okinawa was
   close to zero and therefore it was not considered when evaluating the
   seedlings. For the cv. Capdeboscq, significant differences were found
   only for the variable of days taken to achieve 70\% seedling-emergence,
   112 to 123 days, except for that treatment with the greatest time at
   low-temperatures, which did not reach 70\% emergence. It is concluded
   that periods of stratification and low temperatures offer no advantage
   to obtaining rootstocks of these peach cultivars, for the conditions
   under which the experiment was carried out.}},

@article{Schlindwein2013,
	Abstract = {{Pindo palm (Butia odorata) is a native, endangered palm species from
   southern Brazil. Seed dormancy limits its use and conservation. The aim
   of this study was to evaluate the interactive effects of incubation
   temperature, drying and storage of diaspores of Butia odorata on seed
   germination. In a first trial, diaspores were submitted to the 15
   possible combinations of five temperature regimes and three drying
   conditions. In a second trial, the germination from diaspores that
   underwent the drying treatments and had been stored for 90 days was
   compared with that from non-stored diaspores. The greatest rate of
   seedling emergence was obtained when diaspores were pre-heated at 40
   degrees C for 21 days in moist sand, and then kept at a constant
   temperature of 30 degrees C. Continuous temperatures of 30 and 40
   degrees C did not favour emergence. Drying periods of 24 and 48 hours
   reduced the initial moisture content of the diaspores and increased the
   speed of emergence index from 1.5 to 3.1 and 2.6, respectively. Storage
   did not affect germination but changed the response to the seed-drying
   conditions. We suggest that a dry and warm stratification requirement
   for the alleviation of seed dormancy could be acting in order to ensure
   germination and seedling establishment of B. odorata after the summer.}},

	Abstract = {{Crocus alatavicus Regel et Sem. is a cormous perennial primarily
   distributed in central Asia that may have potential in horticulture;
   however, relatively little is known about seed dormancy in the genus
   Crocus. The primary aim of the present study was to identify the
   dormancy breaking and germination requirements of seeds of C. alatvicus
   and to assign them to a dormancy category. In its natural habitat, the
   underdeveloped embryo in C. alatavicus seeds grows in early summer, and
   radicles emerge in early autumn. However, cotyledon emergence is delayed
   until the following spring. Radicle emergence was promoted by warm
   stratification and cotyledon emergence by cold stratification. GA(3) was
   ineffective in promoting either radicle or epicotyl emergence. We
   conclude that seeds of C. alatavicus have deep simple epicotyl
   morphophysiological dormancy of the type C1bB(root) - C-3(shoot). To our
   knowledge, this is the first detailed study on the ecophysiology of seed
   dormancy and germination in the genus Crocus.}},

	Abstract = {{The individual and combined effect of moist-chilling and thermo-priming
   on germination parameters (capacity, speed, lag and dormancy index) were
   evaluated using seed lots representing British Columbia's five white
   spruce (Picea glauca) seed planning zones. The combined effect of
   moist-chilling followed by a 3-day priming at 15 or 20 degrees C,
   stimulated seed germination across all seed lots. These combined
   treatments resulted in substantial improvement of all germination
   parameters including reducing the dormancy index (14 vs. 25). Generally,
   three days of priming at 20 degrees C yielded a higher percent
   germination than priming for the same period at 15 degrees C,
   irrespective of whether or not seeds had received a previous
   moist-chilling treatment. Thermo-priming alone led to some improvement
   in germination characteristics such as reducing the time to germination
   onset (lag) and increasing germination speed. These results indicate
   that the combined application of moist-chilling and thermo-priming could
   improve container nursery practices for commercial seedling production
   of white spruce. The positive combined effect of moist-chilling and
   thermo-priming on seed germination offer great potential for generalised
   application to other conifers; however, species-specific treatment

	Abstract = {{Although it has been speculated that seeds of the gymnosperm family
   Podocarpaceae have an underdeveloped embryo, no detailed studies have
   been done to definitively answer this question. Our purpose was to
   determine if embryos in seeds of two species of Podocarpaceae,
   Podocarpus costalis and Nageia nagi, from Taiwan are underdeveloped and
   to examine the kind of dormancy the seeds have. Embryos in fresh seeds
   of P. costalis were 4.6 +/- 0.5 mm long, and they increased in length by
   about 54\% before radicle emergence (germination), demonstrating that
   the embryo is underdeveloped at seed maturity. Seeds germinated to >90\%
   at 30/20, 25/15 and 25 degrees C in light in <= 4 weeks, without any
   cold stratification pretreatment. Thus, seeds of P. costalis have
   morphological dormancy (MD). Embryos in fresh seeds of N. nagi were 7.4
   +/- 0.8 mm long and they increased in length by about 39\% before
   radicle emergence (germination) occurred, indicating that the embryo is
   underdeveloped at seed maturity. Seeds germinated to < 25\% at 30/20 and
   25 degrees C in light in 4 weeks but to > 90\% at the same temperatures
   in 12 weeks. Thus, most seeds of N. nagi have morphophysiological
   dormancy (MPD). Although underdeveloped embryos are considered to be a
   primitive condition in seed plants, they also occur in the most advanced
   orders. The occurrence of underdeveloped embryos in Podocarpaceae
   documents that they are not restricted to a basal clade in gymnosperms.}},

	Abstract = {{Dormancy-breaking and seed germination studies in genus Lilium reveal
   that the majority of Lilium spp. studied have an underdeveloped embryo
   at maturity, which grows inside the seed before the radicle emerges.
   Additionally, the embryo, radicle or cotyledon has a physiological
   component of dormancy; thus, Lilium seeds have morphophysiological
   dormancy (MPD). A previous study suggested that seeds of Lilium
   polyphyllum have MPD but the study did not investigate the development
   of the embryo, which is one of the main criteria to determine MPD in
   seeds. To test this hypothesis, we investigated embryo growth and
   emergence of radicles and epicotyls in seeds over a range of
   temperatures. At maturity, seeds had underdeveloped embryos which
   developed fully at warm temperature within 6 weeks. Immediately after
   embryo growth, radicles also emerged at warm temperatures. However,
   epicotyls failed to emerge soon after radicle emergence. Epicotyls
   emerged from > 90\% seeds with an emerged radicle only after they were
   subjected to 2 weeks of cold moist stratification. The overall
   temperature requirements for dormancy-breaking and seed germination
   indicate a non-deep simple epicotyl MPD in L. polyphyllum.}},

	Abstract = {{Mature seeds of Ilex species usually contain immature embryos and are
   extremely difficult to germinate. Ilex latifolia and I. rotunda, two
   species that are grown as ornamentals, also produce seeds that are
   difficult to germinate. In the present study, we investigated some
   factors affecting seed germination in those species. Although seeds of L
   latifolia and I. rotunda could imbibe water, they did not germinate.
   When embryos were cultured in vitro, germination was observed in I.
   lattfolia but not in I. rotunda. Interestingly, a transient decrease in
   germination frequency occurred in I. latifolia embryos isolated from
   seeds collected in September or October. Among five types of I.
   latifolia seeds that differed in the presence of the endocarp, testa,
   and endosperm, germinability of isolated embryos was highest. Good
   germination was also observed in quarter-seeds with or without endocarp
   followed by half-seeds. Treatment of seeds with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
   had no effect on seed germination in I. latifolia. Cold stratification
   at 5 degrees C increased the germination frequency of I. latifolia
   embryos. In conclusion, the data suggested a mechanical barrier by the
   endocarp and inhibitors contained in the endosperm, testa, and/or
   endocarp inhibited seed germination in I. latifolia. Although no seeds
   or embryos of I. rotunda germinated, cold stratification in combination
   with other treatments deserves further investigation. Chemical name:

   Mediterranean Macchia. A. unedo is used as an ornamental plant and as
   cut foliage, whereas the other two species have the potential to be
   introduced to the floricultural industry. This study was carried out to
   clarify whether the seeds of these Arbutus species possess dormancy to
   determine the temperature range for their germination and the effects of
   storage period on germination. Seeds of the three species, which were
   stored dry at 25 degrees C for either three or 11 months, germinated at
   very high percentages (82\% to 99\%) and in a short period of time (24
   to 46 days) when incubated at 15 or 10 degrees C without any
   pretreatment proving that they do not possess dormancy; germination was
   faster at 15 degrees C. At 20 degrees C only seeds of A. unedo and A.
   andrachne stored for three months germinated (29\% to 34\%), whereas at
   25 degrees C, there was practically no germination. Seeds stored for
   three months germinated (61\% to 75\%) when incubated at 5 degrees C,
   but the germination was delayed and the seedlings did not grow further
   than the appearance of the radicle unless transferred at a higher
   temperature (10 to 25 degrees C). After 27 months of dry storage at 25

@article{Debska2013,
	Abstract = {{Reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species play a signaling role
   in seed dormancy alleviation and germination. Their action may be
   described by the oxidative/nitrosative ``window/door{''}. ROS
   accumulation in embryos could lead to oxidative modification of protein
   through carbonylation. Mature apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) seeds are
   dormant and do not germinate. Their dormancy may be overcome by 70-90
   days long cold stratification. The aim of this work was to analyze the
   relationship between germinability of embryos isolated from cold (5
   degrees C) or warm (25 degrees C) stratified apple seeds and ROS or
   nitric oxide (NO) production and accumulation of protein carbonyl
   groups. A biphasic pattern of variation in H2O2 concentration in the
   embryos during cold stratification was detected. H2O2 content increased
   markedly after 7 days of seeds imbibition at 5 degrees C. After an
   additional two months of cold stratification, the H2O2 concentration in
   embryos reached the maximum. NO production by the embryos was low during
   entire period of stratification, but increased significantly in
   germination sensu stricto (i.e. phase II of the germination process).
   The highest content of protein carbonyl groups was detected after 6
   weeks of cold stratification treatment. Fluctuation of H2O2 and protein
   carbonylation seems to play a pivotal role in seed dormancy alleviation
   by cold stratification, while NO appears to be necessary for seed
   germination. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

@article{Gimenez-Benavides2013,
	Abstract = {{Seeds of high-mountain species are thought to germinate rapidly,
   synchronously and at high percentages after a cold period, with limited
   dependence on the external environment; yet, empirical evidence only
   partially supports this behaviour. We performed a comparative study of
   the germination response of two closely related taxa along an altitude
   gradient in northern Spain. Seeds from several maternal families of six
   populations of Saxifraga trifurcata (lowland species) and S.canaliculata
   (highland species) were subjected to temperature and stratification
   treatments. Germination percentages and germination rates were analysed
   using generalised linear mixed modelling and accelerated failure-time
   modelling. We found that germination percentages and germination rates
   were high and dependent on incubation temperature in both species.
   Within species, seeds from higher altitudes had higher germination
   percentages under all conditions. Coldwet stratification negatively
   affected germination success, particularly in the lowland species.
   Overall, the highland species was less responsive to the experimental
   treatments and showed more synchronous germination patterns. We conclude
   that seeds from these two Saxifraga species germinate as efficiently as
   species from other habitats, but have a narrower germination response,
   probably due to the stronger selective pressures in their harsh
   environments. Finally, a cold, wet stratification period is not a
   prerequisite for the germination of high-mountain S.canaliculata, and
   its strong negative effect on the germination of its lowland relative
   S.trifurcata may contribute to the altitudinal segregation of these two
   species.}},

@article{Kepczynski2013,
	Abstract = {{Freshly harvested, dormant seeds of Amaranthus retroflexus were unable
   to germinate at 25 and 35 A degrees C. To release their dormancy at the
   above temperatures, the seeds were stratified at a constant temperature
   (4 A degrees C) under laboratory conditions or at fluctuating
   temperatures in soil or by outdoor burial in soil. Fully dormant, or
   seeds stratified or buried (2006/2007 and 2007/2008) for various periods
   were treated with exogenous gibberellic acid (GA(3)), ethephon and
   abscisic acid (ABA). Likewise, the effects of these regulators, applied
   during stratification, on seed germination were determined. The results
   indicate that A. retroflexus seed dormancy can be released either by
   stratification or by autumn-winter burial. The effect of GA(3) and
   ethylene, liberated from ethephon, applied after various periods of
   stratification or during stratification, depends on dormancy level.
   GA(3) did not affect or only slightly stimulated the germination of
   non-stratified, fully dormant seeds at 25 and 35 A degrees C
   respectively. Ethylene increased germination at both temperatures. Seed
   response to GA(3) and ethylene at 25 A degrees C was increased when
   dormancy was partially removed by stratification at constant or
   fluctuating temperatures or autumn-winter burial. The response to GA(3)
   and ethylene increased with increasing time of stratification. The
   presence of GA(3) and ethephon during stratification may stimulate
   germination at 35 A degrees C. Thus, both GA(3) and ethylene can
   partially substitute the requirement for stratification or autumn-winter
   burial. Both hormones may also stimulate germination of secondary
   dormant seeds, exhumed in September. The response to ABA decreased in
   parallel with an increasing time of stratification and burial up to May
   2007 or March 2008. Endogenous GA(n), ethylene and ABA may be involved
   in the control of dormancy state and germination of A. retroflexus. It
   is possible that releasing dormancy by stratification or partial burial
   is associated with changes in ABA/GA and ethylene balance and/or
   sensitivity to these hormones.}},

	Abstract = {{The germination requirements of 19 herbs in the Australian Alps were
   investigated to determine which species may be sensitive to predicted
   climate changes. Seeds were subjected to factorial treatments of cold
   stratification for 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks, followed by incubation at
   constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C and alternating
   temperatures of 20/5 and 20/10 degrees C. Germination responses were
   used to identify stratification-dependent species, to classify dormancy
   and to determine optimum conditions for laboratory germination. Ordinal
   logistic regression was used to determine whether the duration of
   stratification required for 50\% germination could be predicted by seed
   weight, seed length, embryo:seed ratio or species distribution
   (latitudinal range, altitudinal range and maximum altitude). The
   KruskalWallis test was used to determine any significant differences in
   stratification requirement between endospermic and non-endospermic
   seeds. Species varied considerably in their response to the treatment
   combinations, and therefore their dormancy class. No significant
   predictors of stratification requirement were identified by ordinal
   logistic regression (0.9); however, there was a significant difference
   in stratification requirement between endospermic and non-endospermic
   seeds (P=0.003). Species with non-endospermic seeds did not require any
   stratification to germinate well over a range of temperatures, and
   appear most likely to remain stable or expand in range in response to
   climate warming. Conversely, the need for 8 weeks of cold stratification
   was associated with the presence of endosperm and either a restricted
   distribution or upland ecotypes of widely distributed species. Alpine
   species with endospermic seed and a restricted distribution are most
   likely to contract in range under climate change and would be
   appropriate to prioritize for exsitu conservation.(c) 2013 The Linnean

	Abstract = {{Dormancy is a condition that delays or inhibits growth in seed,
   vegetative buds, and floral buds. In peach, seed germination occurs when
   seed accumulate sufficient stratification and growing degree hours to
   break dormancy and begin growing. Correlations have been reported
   between mean seed stratification requirements and mean bud chilling
   requirements among Prunus families, but an individual seed's germination
   date and subsequent vegetative and floral bud break date are not
   correlated. Prior to this study, the genetic factors involved in
   regulating seed dormancy and their location on the peach genomic map
   were unknown. Segregating F-2 seed were collected from a high x low
   chill F-1 peach hybrid in 2005, 2006, and 2008. Germination date and
   growth habit was measured after the stratification requirement of the
   2005 seed was fully met. The seed collected in 2006 and 2008 received
   varying amounts of stratification, which enabled data on stratification
   requirement, heat requirement, and growth habit to be collected. Genomic
   DNA was extracted from seedling leaf tissue and screened with SSR
   markers selected from the Prunus reference map at an average resolution
   of 20 cM. Seed dormancy quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected on
   G1, G4, G6/8, and G7. The QTLs detected on G6/8 and G7 were discovered

@article{Brzyski2013,
	Abstract = {{Conservation of rare species often involves restoration efforts to
   enhance or expand existing populations, a critical step of which is seed
   germination. Seed germination can be especially problematic in riparian
   zones where habitat disturbance through flooding can be a regular and
   frequent event. Spiraea virginiana Britton, a riparian clonal shrub, is
   a rare species that is particularly susceptible to problems at the seed
   stage; it is generally assumed to lack effective seed recruitment,
   although seeds are sometimes observed in the field. Therefore, we
   examined the effects of growth substrate and cold stratification on the
   number of days required for seeds to germinate and overall seed
   germination success. Overall, total seed germination for S. virginiana
   was low at only 10\% and cold stratification had a significant effect on
   the initiation of germination; as the number of days of cold
   stratification increased, the time necessary for seeds to germinate
   decreased. Although seedlings of S. virginiana have not been observed in
   nature, this study indicates that seeds can germinate and thus
   recruitment by seed is at least theoretically possible. We recommend
   that a seed germination protocol using sterile soil with cold (5 degrees
   C), stratification treatment of at least 30 d should be used in future
   propagation and restoration efforts.}},

	Abstract = {{Acer velutinum Boiss is a valuable tree species native to Iran, and its
   seeds possess physiological dormancy that hampers seedling production in
   the nursery for large-scale reforestation efforts. The aim of this study
   was to determine the optimal dormancy breaking treatments for A.
   velutinum seeds. We conducted a factorial experiment involving six seed
   lots collected along an elevation gradient from 300 to 1800 m at 300 m
   interval and four cold-moist stratification periods (0, 4, 8 and 16
   weeks) at 4 degrees C and 70\% relative humidity. The result shows that
   the germination of cold-moist stratified seeds was significantly (p <
   0.0001) higher than the control for all seed lots. The highest
   germination capacity was recorded after 16 weeks of cold-moist
   stratification for all seed lots (68\%-88\% depending on the seed lot)
   except those collected from mid altitude sites (600 and 900 m) that
   germinated equally well (>= 75\%) after 4- and 8-week of clod-moist
   stratification compared to the other seed lots. The mean germination
   time was significantly shorter (12 to 19 days, depending on the seed
   lot) for seeds stratified for 16 weeks than for untreated seeds. It can
   be concluded that: (1) cold-moist stratification for 16 weeks is the
   best pre-sowing treatment for breaking dormancy in A. velutinum seeds;
   and (2) seeds should be collected from mid altitude sites (600 and 900
   m) to get more than 80\% germination within 15 days, and these seed lots
   even required shorter cold-moist stratification period (eight weeks)
   than other seed lots.}},

@article{Shu2013,
	Abstract = {{Seed dormancy is an important economic trait for agricultural
   production. Abscisic acid (ABA) and Gibberellins (GA) are the primary
   factors that regulate the transition from dormancy to germination, and
   they regulate this process antagonistically. The detailed regulatory
   mechanism involving crosstalk between ABA and GA, which underlies seed
   dormancy, requires further elucidation. Here, we report that ABI4
   positively regulates primary seed dormancy, while negatively regulating
   cotyledon greening, by mediating the biogenesis of ABA and GA. Seeds of
   the Arabidopsis abi4 mutant that were subjected to short-term storage
   (one or two weeks) germinated significantly more quickly than Wild-Type
   (WT), and abi4 cotyledons greened markedly more quickly than WT, while
   the rates of germination and greening were comparable when the seeds
   were subjected to longer-term storage (six months). The ABA content of
   dry abi4 seeds was remarkably lower than that of WT, but the amounts
   were comparable after stratification. Consistently, the GA level of abi4
   seeds was increased compared to WT. Further analysis showed that abi4
   was resistant to treatment with paclobutrazol (PAC), a GA biosynthesis
   inhibitor, during germination, while OE-ABI4 was sensitive to PAC, and
   exogenous GA rescued the delayed germination phenotype of OE-ABI4.
   Analysis by qRT-PCR showed that the expression of genes involved in ABA
   and GA metabolism in dry and germinating seeds corresponded to hormonal
   measurements. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR (ChIP-qPCR)
   and transient expression analysis showed that ABI4 repressed CYP707A1
   and CYP707A2 expression by directly binding to those promoters, and the
   ABI4 binding elements are essential for this repression. Accordingly,
   further genetic analysis showed that abi4 recovered the delayed
   germination phenotype of cyp707a1 and cyp707a2 and further, rescued the
   non-germinating phenotype of ga1-t. Taken together, this study suggests
   that ABI4 is a key factor that regulates primary seed dormancy by
   mediating the balance between ABA and GA biogenesis.}},

@article{Wood2013,
	Abstract = {{Seeds of Echinacea species have endogenous physiological dormancy.
   Dormancy release is induced by moist chilling stratification, but seeds
   treated with ethylene can show increased germination comparable to
   stratification. The primary aims of this work were to discover whether
   endogenous ethylene production was required for dormancy release and
   germination in Echinacea seeds and to investigate the physiological
   basis for stratification and ethylene-induced dormancy release. There
   were no significant differences in ethylene production in untreated
   versus stratified seeds. Seeds subjected to a dormancy release treatment
   showed reduced sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Isolated
   embryos were completely released from dormancy when the outer envelope
   surrounding the embryo was removed. Isolated embryos with the envelope
   intact were also induced to germinate when treated with ACC
   (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) to increase ethylene production.
   It was determined that the covering envelope was derived from
   enlargement of the endothelium layer surrounding the egg sac
   (integumentary tapetum) plus several crushed layers of the outer
   integument. Ethylene does not appear to be required for dormancy release
   and germination in Echinacea seeds. Two possible physiological
   mechanisms were discovered to explain stratification and
   ethylene-induced dormancy release. These included a change in seed
   sensitivity to ABA and changes in the tissues covering the embryo. The
   data suggests that ethylene-induced dormancy release is independent of
   stratification and possibly acts by inducing physiological events that
   are normally downstream of stratification. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   20 seeds, n = 3) and seedling growth (four aroid species, n = 25).
   Seedling survival of six aroid species transplanted to three heights (n
   = 27) was monitored in situ. Some species did not germinate under severe
   recurrent drought while others germinated at the same rate in all
   treatments. Seedlings of the most exposed species grew fastest under
   intermediate recurrent drought while those of the other three species
   grew fastest when kept constantly wet. Survival of transplanted
   seedlings did not depend on species attachment height, but this may be
   attributable to insufficient statistical power. Taken together, the
   results suggest that the stratification can be explained to a large
   degree by differential sensitivity to the vertical moisture gradient
   during the regeneration phase.}},

	Abstract = {{Across their range, widely distributed species are exposed to a variety
   of climatic and other environmental conditions, and accordingly may
   display variation in life history strategies. For seed germination in
   cold climates, two contrasting responses to variation in winter
   temperature have been documented: first, an increased ability to
   germinate at low temperatures (cold tolerance) as winter temperatures
   decrease, and secondly a reduced ability to germinate at low
   temperatures (cold avoidance) that concentrates germination towards the
   warmer parts of the season.
   Germination responses were tested for Calluna vulgaris, the dominant
   species of European heathlands, from ten populations collected along
   broad-scale bioclimatic gradients (latitude, altitude) in Norway,
   covering a substantial fraction of the species climatic range.
   Incubation treatments varied from 10 to 25 C, and germination
   performance across populations was analysed in relation to temperature
   conditions at the seed collection locations.
   Seeds from all populations germinated rapidly and to high final
   percentages under the warmer incubation temperatures. Under low
   incubation temperatures, cold-climate populations had significantly
   lower germination rates and percentages than warm-climate populations.
   While germination rates and percentages also increased with seed mass,
   seed mass did not vary along the climatic gradients, and therefore did
   not explain the variation in germination responses.
   Variation in germination responses among Calluna populations was
   consistent with increased temperature requirements for germination
   towards colder climates, indicating a cold-avoidance germination
   strategy conditional on the temperature at the seeds origin. Along a
   gradient of increasing temperatures this suggests a shift in selection
   pressures on germination from climatic adversity (i.e. low temperatures
   and potential frost risk in early or late season) to competitive
   performance and better exploitation of the entire growing season.}},

   of time, but this information is still conspicuously lacking for Mexican
   oaks. This is the case of Quercus polymorpha, a drought-tolerant species
   widely distributed across Sierra Madre Oriental that can be used in
   forest restoration programs. The acorns used to develop their saplings
   are collected during the reproductive season and stored by several
   months before their germination. This study focused in 1) determining
   how many seeds are lost during storage because of physiological factors
   linked to their viability, 2) quantifying how many seeds were lost by
   other factors, and 3) assessing whether cold stratification can
   stimulate acorn germination. Acorns used in this study were stored
   during a round year. We found that 70 \% of these acorns were
   parasitized by insects prior to their storage, while an additional 20 \%
   had lost their viability due to physiological factors or fungal
   infestation. Germination trials were performed by only using potentially
   viable acorns, which were subjected to three different cold
   stratification periods (0, 20 and 50 days). This experiment indicated

@article{Boddy2013,
	Abstract = {{Echinochloaoryzicola(syn.E. phyllopogon) is an exotic weed of California
   rice paddies that has evolved resistance to multiple herbicides.
   Elimination of seedlingsthroughcertain weed control methods can limit
   the spread of this weed, but is contingent on accurate predictions of
   germination and emergence timing, which are influenced by seed dormancy
   levels. In summer annuals, dormancy can often be relieved through
   stratification, a period of prolonged exposure to cold and moist
   conditions. We used population-based threshold models to quantify the
   effects of stratification on seed germination of four E. Oryzicola
   populations at a range of water potential (Psi) and oxygen levels. We
   also determined how stratification temperatures, moisture levels and
   durations contributed to dormancy release. Stratification released
   dormancy by decreasing base Psi and hydrotimerequired for germination
   and by eliminating any germination sensitivity to oxygen. Stratification
   also increased average germination rates (GR), which were used as a
   proxy for relative dormancy levels. Alternating temperatures nearly
   doubled GR in all populations, indicating that seeds could be partially
   dormant despite achieving high final germination percentages.
   Stratification at Psi=0 MPa increased GR compared to stratification at
   lower water potentials, demonstrating that Psi contributed to regulating
   dormancy release. Maximum GR occurred after 2-4 weeks of stratification
   at 0 MPa; GR were often more rapid for herbicide-resistant than for
   herbicide-susceptible seeds, implying greater dormancy in the latter.
   Manipulation of field conditions to promote dormancy alleviation of E.
   oryzicola seeds might improve the rate and uniformity of germination for
   seed bank depletion through seedling weed control. Our results suggest
   field soil saturation in winter would contribute towards E. oryzicola
   dormancy release and decrease the time to seedling emergence.}},

	Abstract = {{Cold stratification supposedly allows dormant seeds to germinate by
   removing their metabolic blocks. Nothing is known about the role of
   mitochondrial enzymes in metabolic regulation of seeds during dormancy
   release. As cold stratification removes walnut (Juglans regia L) kernel
   dormancy, the activities of three mitochondrial enzymes i.e. pyruvate
   dehydiogenase complex (PDH), NAD(+)-isocitrate dehydrogenase
   (NAD(+)-IDH; EC 1.1.1.41), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH; EC 1.3.99.1)
   and the extra-mitochondrial glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH; EC
   1.1.1.49) were compared in both cold-stratified (5 C; 60 days) and
   warm-incubated (27 degrees C; 20 days) kernels. The kernel gluconeogenic
   competence was also assessed by measuring the activity of
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.49). These were then
   correlated to kernel lipid hydroperoxide contents and lipoxygenase (EC
   1.13.11.12) activity. Lipid hydroperoxides and lipoxygenase activity
   were significantly greater in warm-incubated kernels. The mitochondrial
   NAD(+)-IDH activity was indifferent between cold-stratified and
   warm-incubated kernels. The activities of PDH and SDH though
   undetectable in cold-stratified kernels, were relatively high under warm
   conditions. Succinate oxidation in cold stratified kernels however, was
   achieved by a glyoxysomal succinate oxidase activity formerly reported
   in monocotyledons. Furthermore, the kernel succinate oxidase, PEPCK and
   G6PDH activities were significantly greater at cold conditions. It was
   concluded that cold induced dormancy release of walnut kernels is
   associated with suppression of kernel mitochondrial respiration and
   oxidative stress and meanwhile it allows activation of oxidative pentose
   phosphate (OPP) and post-glyoxylate cycle gluconeogenesis pathways. The
   build-up of oxidative stress and toxic lipid hydroperoxide derivatives
   however, probably result in the compromised germination of
   warm-incubated walnut kernels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

	Abstract = {{Mediterranean mountain species face exacting ecological conditions of
   rainy, cold winters and arid, hot summers, which affect seed germination
   phenology. In this study, a soil heat sum model was used to predict
   field emergence of Rhamnus persicifolia, an endemic tree species living
   at the edge of mountain streams of central eastern Sardinia.
   Seeds were incubated in the light at a range of temperatures (1025 and
   25/10 C) after different periods (up to 3 months) of cold stratification
   at 5 C. Base temperatures (T-b), and thermal times for 50 germination
   (THETA(50)) were calculated. Seeds were also buried in the soil in two
   natural populations (Rio Correboi and Rio Olai), both underneath and
   outside the tree canopy, and exhumed at regular intervals. Soil
   temperatures were recorded using data loggers and soil heat sum (Cd) was
   calculated on the basis of the estimated T-b and soil temperatures.
   Cold stratification released physiological dormancy (PD), increasing
   final germination and widening the range of germination temperatures,
   indicative of a Type 2 non-deep PD. T-b was reduced from 105 C for
   non-stratified seeds to 27 C for seeds cold stratified for 3 months. The
   best thermal time model was obtained by fitting probit germination
   against log Cd. THETA(50) was 26 log Cd for untreated seeds and 217219
   log Cd for stratified seeds. When THETA(50) values were integrated with
   soil heat sum estimates, field emergence was predicted from March to
   April and confirmed through field observations.
   T-b and THETA(50) values facilitated model development of the thermal
   niche for in situ germination of R. persicifolia. These experimental
   approaches may be applied to model the natural regeneration patterns of
   other species growing on Mediterranean mountain waterways and of
   physiologically dormant species, with overwintering cold stratification
   requirement and spring germination.}},

@article{Hoyle2014,
	Abstract = {{The life stages of seed germination and seedling establishment play a
   vital role in maintaining plant populations and determining range
   dynamics of species. Thus, it is not surprising that specific
   germination requirements and dormancy mechanisms have evolved in all
   major angiosperm clades. In a rapidly changing climate, we face growing
   pressure to manage, conserve and restore native plant species and
   communities. To achieve these aims, we require solid knowledge of
   whether and how seed germination requirements and dormancy status vary
   between different populations of a given species and how germination
   strategies may be affected by warming climatic conditions. We assessed
   the effect of decreasing durations of cold stratification (i.e.
   conditions representing a shortened winter as predicted under climate
   change) on germination and dormancy of the alpine herb Aciphylla
   glacialis. Our results confirmed previous research showing that A.
   glacialis seeds possess physiological dormancy that can be alleviated by
   cold stratification. In addition, the results demonstrated that A.
   glacialis seeds have underdeveloped embryos at dispersal; these grow to
   germinable size following 4-9 weeks at both constant 5 degrees C and
   10-5 degrees C (day-night) temperatures. We conclude that A. glacialis
   exhibits morphophysiological dormancy. Furthermore, we found that the
   final percentage germination and dormancy status varied significantly
   among natural populations and that this variation did not correlate with
   elevation at the site of seed origin. Seeds germinated following 6-8
   weeks of cold stratification, and seedlings showed no detrimental
   effects as a result of shorter stratification periods. Together, these
   results suggest that reduced duration of winter is unlikely to have
   direct negative impacts on germination or early seedling growth in A.
   glacialis. The causes and implications of the population variation in
   germination traits are discussed.}},

@article{Huang2014,
	Abstract = {{The Nymphoides peltata population expands quickly in Lake Taihu, China.
   One question addressed in this study is whether the seeds of N. peltata
   contribute to this expansion. The buoyancy and germination of N. peltata
   seeds and the development of N. peltata seedlings were studied, using
   seeds collected from Lake Taihu. The results indicated that a low wind
   velocity of 2.4-3.0 m s(-1) had a slightly negative effect on seed
   buoyancy. After 19 and 67 h of gentle stirring, 50\% and 90\%,
   respectively, of the N. peltata seeds had sunk. Few seeds floated again
   after sinking, but these refloating seeds sank soon with the
   disturbance. The N. peltata seeds did not germinate without
   stratification, but the stratification of seeds for a two-week period
   resulted in a high germination rate (63.3\%) at a light intensity of 20
   mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Both the light and stratification treatments
   stimulated the seeds germination. The seeds did not germinate in
   sediment at depths greater than 0.25 cm. A high germination rate (74\%)
   was observed for the seeds that laid on the water-sediment interface;
   however, nearly all of the germinated seeds floated on the water surface
   after germination. Only a small fraction (14\%) of the buoyant seedlings
   could re-establish in shallow water (less than 3 cm). In the eighth week
   of the experiments, the buoyant seedlings that failed to re-establish
   rotted. When grown in low light intensity conditions, the N. peltata
   seedlings had smaller cotyledons, shorter primary roots, and weak
   development of adventitious roots. Sufficient light was important for
   both seed germination and seedling development. It was found that sexual
   reproduction is likely to have little direct contribution to the rapid
   expansion of N. peltata towards the centre of this large shallow lake.

   ripe fruit of the sweet cherry cultivar `Lambert' were collected and,
   after removing the endocarp, various dormancy-breaking treatments such
   as seed washing, the application of exogenous gibberellic acid (GA(3)),
   or cold stratification were evaluated for their ability to enhance the
   percentage and rate of seed germination. The results indicated that seed
   washing was necessary to break dormancy in sweet cherry. The seed
   germination percentage and rate improved to 26.5\% and 1.17 seed d(-1)
   simply by washing the seed for 24 h. The application of up to 500 mg
   l(-1) GA(3), in addition to a seed washing treatment, further improved
   both the seed germination percentage and rate to 47.1\% and 1.9 seed
   d(-1), respectively. Although the seed germination percentage improved
   as a result of 6 weeks of cold stratification, a longer cold period (8
   weeks) was required to obtain the maximum rate of germination. The

	Abstract = {{Pimelea trichostachya Lindl., P. simplex F.Muell. and P. elongata
   Threlfall frequently cause pimelea poisoning of cattle. Fresh seeds of
   these species, belonging to sect. Epallage (Endl.) Benth. of Pimelea
   Gaertn. (Thymelaeaceae) are strongly dormant for years when in
   laboratory storage. Common methods of stimulating germination, such as
   scarification, dry heat and cold stratification, did not remove much of
   the dormancy. `Smoke water' stimulated some germination but its effect
   was unpredictable and many seedlings then grew aberrantly. Exposure of
   imbibed seeds to gibberellic acid greatly and reliably improved the
   germination of all three species. However, the manner of application and
   the concentration of gibberellic acid used had to be appropriate or many
   young seedlings grew abnormally or died suddenly, limiting successful
   plant establishment rates. The dormancy type involved is non-deep Type 2
   physiological. Ten days of good moisture, in addition to gibberellic
   acid exposure, is required before appreciable laboratory germination
   occurs at optimal temperatures. Thus, the mechanism by which gibberellic
   acid stimulates good germination does not appear to be the same as that
   which primes seeds for the rapid and prolific germination often seen
   under natural conditions in arid Australia. Seeds of P. simplex subsp.
   continua (J.M.Black) Threlfall proved most difficult to germinate and
   those of P. elongata the easiest.}},

	Abstract = {{This study assessed germination of wheat seeds under cold and biological
   stratification and determined the expression level of gibberellins (GA)
   and abscisic acid (ABA) genes in coleorhiza. Both cold and biological
   stratification significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced the rate and efficacy
   of germination. The spatial distance between the fungal endophyte and
   the seed can be a determining factor of biological stratification as
   seeds in direct contact with fungal endophyte showed the highest rate
   and efficacy of germination. Consistently high expression of GA3ox2 gene
   was found in wheat coleorhiza throughout the tested period of
   germination. The expression of ABA biosynthesis gene, TaNCED, was
   substantially higher in cold stratification seeds, reflecting the role
   of abscisic acid in stress-adaptation. Overall, this study provides
   molecular evidence of the importance of coleorhiza in germinating wheat
   seeds, in addition to reporting that the spatial distance between
   symbiotic partners may be a critical factor driving mycovitality. (c)

	Abstract = {{The present research aims at investigating the combined effects of warm
   stratification (WS)+cold stratification (CS), and gibberellic acid
   (GA(3))+cold stratification (CS) on breaking dormancy and germination in
   seeds of Ostga calpinfolia. The seeds were subjected to WS (20-25
   degrees C) for 0, 1 and 2 months and were subsequendy cold stratified at
   3-5 degrees C for 0, 1, 2, 5 and 4 months (1st experiment) A further
   amount of seeds was treated with 500, 1000 or 2000 ppm GA3 for 30 hours
   and then cold stratified at 35 degrees C for 0, 1, 2, 5 and 4 months
   (2nd experiment). No germination was observed in the seeds subjected to
   only WS (1 and 2 months) or CS for 1 month indicating that the seeds of
   O. carpin:folia are dormant. A 4-month stratification (1 month WS+3
   month CS or 4 month CS) fully released dormancy and led to a high
   germination percentage (94.17 and 98.34\% respectively) in a short time
   (7.12 and 7.00 days respectively). Warm stratification treatment prior
   to CS, was not required in order to break the seed dormancy of O.
   carpinifolza and also did not reduce the length of the (total)
   stratification period required for breaking seed dormancy. Gibberellic
   acid (GA3) application entirely replaced the CS period required for
   breaking seed dormancy. The germination of the seeds treated only with
   2000 ppm CA(3) (0 months of CS) was (94.17\%) as high as the germination
   of the seeds subjected to 4 months of CS (98.34\%). It is obvious that
   the seedcoat of O. carpinffblia seeds was permeable to GA3 and did not
   mechanically restrict embryo growth, thus, the seeds did not exhibit
   physical dormancy. Based on dormancy breaking requirements, the O.
   carpinffblia seeds displayed intermediate physiological dormancy.}},

   widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean region. The germination
   requirements (under different controlled conditions of light and
   temperature, and after two pre-sowing treatments) and tolerance to
   osmotic stress (polyethylene glycol, PEG 6000) and salinity (NaCl) of P.
   albicans seeds were studied. Seeds were germinated under constant
   temperatures (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25
   degrees C and 30 degrees C) and alternating temperature regimes of 20/10
   degrees C and 25/15 degrees C with a 16h/8h light/dark photoperiod. The
   outer layer of seeds become mucilaginous when wetted and the presence of
   mucilage on seeds significantly increased germination percentages at all
   temperatures tested. P. albicans seeds were non-dormant and temperature
   significantly affected germination percentages and germination rate
   (germination velocity expressed as mean germination time, MGT). The
   final germination percentages ranged from 34\% to 89\% for intact seeds
   (seeds with mucilage) and from 9\% to 62\% for demucilaged seeds,
   depending on the temperature. Temperatures of 25 degrees C and 25/15
   degrees C gave the highest germination percentages. Light did not affect
   seed germination at both temperature regimes assayed (25 degrees C and
   25/15 degrees C). Germination percentages of seeds soaked for 24h in
   distilled water or in a gibberellic acid (GA(3)) solution were not
   significantly higher than that of untreated seeds. In general, both the
   final germination percentage and germination rate were reduced by
   increasing salinity and PEG concentration. Seeds germinated in up to
   35\% PEG and 300mmol center dot L-1 NaCl. Recovery of germination for
   seeds when transferred to distilled water after being in PEG or salinity
   treatments for 15 days was quite high, suggesting that P. albicans seeds
   are tolerant to osmotic and salt stresses.}},

	Abstract = {{In response to hurricane and oil-spill environmental impacts along the
   northern Gulf of Mexico, coastal and marine habitat restoration has
   become a priority. In particular, restoration of submerged aquatic
   plants is vital for ecosystem health. To facilitate restoration,
   developing propagation protocols for Gulf coast plants is necessary, but
   challenging due to the lack of information on many species. Previous
   seed germination research of Vallisneria americana, a submerged aquatic
   species with declining abundance in coastal habitats, from northern
   latitudinal populations reported germination percentages between
   80-90\%. Germination experiments using Mississippi Gulf coast plants
   revealed unexpected outcomes. Less than 8\% germination occurred when
   seeds were germinated in a 16 hr photoperiod or 24 hr dark period at 10,
   20, 30 or 40 degrees C. To enhance germination, cold stratification and
   gibberellic acid soak treatments were conducted, but germination was
   below 10\%. A subsequent seed scarification experiment was conducted
   that resulted in 90\% germination when incubated at 30 degrees C. In
   addition, an imbibition experiment revealed that both scarified and
   non-scarified seeds imbibed water. Due to this imbibition, V. americana
   seeds used in this study were considered to be physiologically dormant.
   Refining existing seed-based propagation protocols is recommended to
   ensure the success of revegetation in restoration projects.}},

	Abstract = {{Cacti are characteristic plants in arid ecosystems, where they play an
   important ecological role. Many species are threatened because of
   habitat destruction and collection for commercial purposes. In South
   America, Argentina is one of the countries with the greatest cacti
   richness and endemisms. However, cacti have been scarcely studied,
   especially the southernmost species. Since the study of cacti's
   reproductive biology would help to improve their conservation status, we
   studied basic physiological aspects of the germination of two endemic
   species of Argentina and Chile, Maihuenia patagonica (Phil.) Britton \&
   Rose and Maihueniopsis darwinii (Hensl.) F. Ritter var. hickenii
   (Britton \& Rose) R. Kiesling. Germination percentage (G), mean
   germination time (TMG) and time until germination (IG) of control seeds
   and seeds subjected to three pre-germinative treatments were evaluated.
   Treatments were cold moist stratification for 40 days, mechanical
   scarification with sand and sandpaper, and mechanical scarification with
   a scalpel. Laboratory assays were performed at 20/10 degrees C and 12 h
   light/12 h dark regime during 60 days. In M patagonica germination in
   the stratification treatment did not differ from the control, but was
   higher in the scarification with scalpel. In M darwinii var. hickenii
   germination only differed between the stratification and the
   scarification with scalpel. TMG and IG were higher in the stratification
   treatment than in the control for M patagonica, whereas scarification
   treatments did not differ from the control. As for M darwinii var.
   hickenii no differences were detected for TMG, but the IG was lower in
   the stratification than in the control. Probably both species presents
   some kind of dormancy, since germination percentages were low (M
   patagonica between 8-27 \% and M darwinii var. hickenii between 17-26
   \%) but seeds presented high viability. Presence of physical dormancy is
   discarded because control seeds of both species germinated and the
   presence of non deep physiological dormancy is proposed. The latter was
   partially overcome by mechanical scarification in M patagonica. These
   results are a new contribution to the study of cacti in South America
   and could help to develop in situ conservation strategies through the
   restoration of degraded areas.}},

@article{Hao2014,
	Abstract = {{Epicotyl dormancy break in seeds that have deep simple epicotyl
   morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) requires radicle emergence and even a
   certain root length in some species. However, the mechanisms by which
   root length affects epicotyl dormancy break are not clear at present.
   This study aims to explore the relationship between root length and
   epicotyl dormancy release in radicle-emerged seeds of Tibetan peony,
   Paeonia ludlowii, with discussion of the possible mechanisms.
   Radicle-emerged seeds (radicle length 15, 30, 45 and 60 cm) were
   incubated at 5, 10 and 15 C. During the stratification, some seeds were
   transferred to 15 C and monitored for epicotylplumule growth. Hormone
   content was determined by ELISA, and the role of hormones in epicotyl
   dormancy release was tested by exogenous hormone and embryo culture.
   Cold stratification did not break the epicotyl dormancy until the root
   length was 6 cm. The indole-3-actic acid (IAA) and GA(3) contents of
   seeds having 6 cm roots were significantly higher than those of seeds
   with other root lengths, but the abscisic acid (ABA) content was lowest
   among radicle-emerged seeds. GA(3) (400 mg L-1) could break epicotyl
   dormancy of all radicle-emerged seeds, while IAA (200 mg L-1) had little
   or no effect. When grown on MS medium, radicles of naked embryos grew
   and cotyledons turned green, but epicotyls did not elongate. Naked
   embryos developed into seedlings on a mixed medium of MS 100 mg L-1
   GA(3).
   A root length of 60 cm is necessary for epicotyl dormancy release by
   cold stratification. The underlying reason for root length affecting
   epicotyl dormancy release is a difference in the GA(3)/ABA ratio in the
   epicotyl within radicle-emerged seeds, which is mainly as a result of a
   difference in ABA accumulation before cold stratification.}},

	Abstract = {{Seed mass variation and heteromorphism may afford plant species
   differential germination behavior and ultimately seedling success,
   particularly in disturbed habitats. We asked whether such variation
   occurs in Packera tomentosa (Michx.) C. Jeffrey (Asteraceae), a clonal
   species of the southeastern USA. Seed mass was compared within and among
   genetic individuals differentiated using amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms. We compared central and peripheral seeds produced by disc
   and ray florets, respectively, for their morphology, mass, and
   germination behavior, including response to water availability, aging,
   and cold stratification. Seed mass was highly variable both within and
   among individuals and influenced germination behavior. We found cryptic
   seed heteromorphism in P.tomentosa. Central and peripheral seeds had
   similar morphologies but dissimilar mass and biomass allocation. We used
   failure time analysis to detect different germination behavior. Central
   seeds were heavier, contained larger embryos, and germinated faster and
   at a higher proportion in most germination studies. Highly variable mass
   and heteromorphism of seeds may allow persistence of P.tomentosa in its
   disturbed habitats. Based on our results, some future studies of
   Asteraceae species with disc and ray florets may need to account for
   possible differences between seed types, even when morphological
   differences are not apparent. Evaluation of individual seed mass and
   maternal differences in germination studies may assist in the detection
   of cryptic seed heteromorphism, a phenomenon thought to be common, yet
   rarely documented.}},

	Abstract = {{This study investigated seed germination of Crataegus pseudoheterophylla
   Pojark using different combinations of growth promoting rhizobacteria
   and stratification regimes. The PGPR treatments were Azotobacter
   chroococcum 12, Azospirillum lipoferum OF, Pseudomonas fluorescens 169,
   Bacillus subtilis FzB24 and combinations (co-inoculation) using two or
   all PGPR inoculants. The control was no inoculation followed by
   stratification. Temperature regulation in the stratification regime was
   1 month at the constant temperature of 23 C, then 3 months at 4 degrees
   C. The alternate temperature regime was 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2
   weeks at 23 degrees C followed by 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks
   at 23 degrees C, then 1 month at 4 degrees C. The effects of these
   treatments were evaluated and results showed that treatments of PGPR
   inoculation stimulated germination in terms of percentage of seed
   germination, speed of germination and mean germination time, and effect
   was significant at (p <0.05). Higher percentages of seed germination
   (18.33\%) and speed of germination (4.82 number/day) were recorded for
   co-inoculated seeds by the combination of all bacterial inoculants and
   the alternate temperature stratification regime. Results showed a higher
   percentage of seed germination using alternate temperature
   stratification than for the constant temperature stratification regime.
   These results suggest that PGPRs in combination were effective in terms
   of promoting germination of C pseudoheterophylla seeds. (C) 0 2014

@article{Copete2014,
	Abstract = {{The main goal of the study was to assess germination requirements in a
   threatened daffodil to elaborate a detailed protocol for plant
   production from seeds, a key tool for conservation. Experiments were
   carried out both in the laboratory and outdoor conditions. In
   Pseudonarcissi section, endemic Iberian species of Narcissus studied
   heretofore have different levels of morphophysiological dormancy (MPD).
   Embryo length, radicle emergence, and shoot emergence were analyzed to
   determine the level of MPD. Both interpopulational variability and seed
   storage duration were also studied. Mean embryo length in fresh seeds
   was 1.32 mm and the embryo had to grow until it reached at least 2.00 mm
   to germinate. Embryo growth occurs during warm stratification, after
   which the radicle emerges when temperatures go down. Seed dormancy was
   broken in the laboratory at 28/14 degrees C in darkness followed by 15/4
   degrees C, but the germination percentage varies depending on the
   population. In outdoor conditions, seed dispersal occurs in June, the
   embryo grows during the summer and then the radicle emerges in autumn.
   The radicle system continues to grow during the winter months, but the
   shoot does not emerge until the beginning of the spring because it is
   physiologically dormant and requires a cold period to break dormancy.
   Early cold temperatures interrupt embryo growth and induce dormancy in
   seeds with an advanced embryo development. Seeds of N. eugeniae have
   deep simple epicotyl MPD. In addition, we found that embryo growth and
   germination were improved by seed storage duration.}},

@article{Albrecht2014,
	Abstract = {{Temperate wetland species often require light and warm temperatures for
   seed germination. However, recent studies indicate that species which
   specialize on permanently saturated wetlands that are maintained by
   groundwater discharge (fens, seeps and mountain springs), rather than
   wetlands with surface-water-driven hydrologic regimes, diverge from the
   typical wetland germination niche by germinating at cool temperatures
   and lacking photoblastic seeds. We conducted laboratory experiments that
   manipulated stratification conditions (non-stratified versus cold
   stratification in light and darkness), thermal regime (15/6, 25/15 and
   35/20 degrees C), and light (14 h photoperiod versus continuous
   darkness) to test whether seeds of the North American calcareous fen
   specialist Parnassia grandifolia diverged from the typical temperate
   wetland germination niche. After 30 d, fresh seeds were conditionally
   dormant and could only germinate to high percentages in light at 25/15
   degrees C. During 16 weeks of incubation, non-stratified seeds
   germinated to low percentages (<40\%) at all thermal regimes in
   darkness. In contrast, cold-stratified seeds germinated to high
   percentages in both light and darkness at all thermal regimes, although
   germination was incomplete (no cotyledon emergence) at 35/20 degrees C.
   Further, seeds did not require light during cold stratification to
   germinate to high percentages when incubated in light or darkness. Thus,
   seeds diverged from the typical temperate wetland germination syndrome
   in lacking a light and warm temperature requirement for germination. Our
   results reinforce previous work from European fens and Mediterranean
   wetlands. This indicates that multiple germination strategies are found
   in fen wetlands that are maintained by the continuous or near-continuous
   discharge of cool groundwater.}},

   seeds from populations exposed to cold temperatures need cold
   stratification. We investigated the germination (including embryo
   growth) of non-stratified seeds over a range of temperatures and tested
   the effects of cold stratification and of gibberellins GA(3) and GA(4)
   on germination. The amount and timing of germination among populations
   varied substantially in response to temperature treatments. Seeds from
   all populations of this species required warm temperatures for dormancy
   break and germination, regardless of environmental conditions. As such,
   the majority of seeds had non-deep simple morphophysiological dormancy,
   which, until now, has not been reported in any members of Sambucus. The
   seed characteristics of the subtropical S. chinensis are different from
   those of temperate members of the genus in which cold stratification is
   the predominate treatment to overcome dormancy.}},

	Abstract = {{Populations of Euryale ferox Salisb. have declined throughout its global
   range because of habitat loss and degradation. The present study aimed
   to evaluate the influence of storage temperature (4 and 20 degrees C),
   storage period (0, 90, 180, 270, and 360 days), light condition (light
   and darkness), germination temperature (constant 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30
   degrees C), and seed size (two classes from 0.5 cm to less than 1.2 cm,
   and from 1.2 cm to less than 1.6 cm) on germination of E. ferox seeds.
   Our results indicated that seeds were dormant when shed and 4 degrees C
   stratification promoted germination more effectively than 20 degrees C.
   After stratification at 4 degrees C, the germination frequency of the
   larger seeds peaked at 90 days' stratification, whereas the smaller
   seeds maintained high germination frequencies up to 180 days'
   stratification. The different germination responses between smaller and
   larger seeds may reflect a difference in the rate of induction of
   dormancy in the annual dormancy cycle. Seeds germinated in both light
   and darkness, which demonstrated that light is not involved in the
   regulation of E. ferox seed germination. The optimal temperature for
   germination was 25 degrees C. Light condition x germination temperature
   interaction caused significantly higher germination frequency at 30
   degrees C in light than in darkness, and the opposite trend at 15
   degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

@article{Amat2014,
	Abstract = {{Many seeds are dormant when shed from the mother plant. This unique
   characteristic of plants poses challenges in conservation and many
   different treatments have traditionally been used to break dormancy.
   When germination only occurs under certain circumstances, recruitment
   may be insufficient and the viability of plant populations may be
   threatened. A marked dormancy was previously identified in the Iberian
   critically endangered species Pseudomisopates rivas-martinezii. The
   present study aimed to determine the magnitude of dormancy by estimating
   seed viability under different germination treatments: heat, ash,
   stratification, gibberellin addition, and darkness. Our results indicate
   that there were significant differences in viability across plant
   populations and treatments. Maximum seed germination was obtained under
   ash addition, although cold stratification alone gave a considerable
   enhancement. However, gibberellic acid did not improve germination and
   darkness had a diminishing effect. In conclusion, a cold period is
   required for the species to germinate, coupled with the effects of fire:
   (1) ash, (2) vegetation clearings, and (3) resprouting, which are major
   factors triggering seed germination. Although these conditions are
   widely found in the field, we hypothesize that a more dramatic situation
   may have tackled this species before the increase of human-mediated
   fires in the past millennia.}},

@article{Phartyal2014,
	Abstract = {{Seeds with epicotyl dormancy reside in soil up to 15 months (or longer),
   being exposed to a sequence of temperatures, before seedlings completely
   emerge (i.e. with both roots and shoots). Heretofore, few studies have
   examined precise temperatures, especially in sequences, for promotion of
   radicle and cotyledon emergence and how they relate to environmental
   cues in nature. Viburnum is the best known genus to exhibit epicotyl
   dormancy and, as such, we investigated the Japanese V. furcatum,
   hypothesizing a similar kind and level of dormancy. The under-developed
   embryos in mature seeds in October were spatulate shaped, unlike those
   in other Viburnum species, and they elongated from late June to August
   of the following year. Radicles emerged after embryo growth until
   mid-October, followed by cotyledons from mid-April to mid-May.
   Temperatures required for embryo growth, radicle and cotyledon emergence
   in the laboratory approximated closely those in the field. Embryo
   elongation and radicle emergence occurred at warm temperature regimes,
   and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) did not substitute for this warm
   temperature requirements. Following a 120-d cold stratification of seeds
   with an emerged radicle, shoots emerged from seeds at 10, 15, 15/5,
   20/10 and 25/15 degrees C. We identified that seeds of V. furcatum have
   deep simple epicotyl morphophysiological dormancy like the majority of
   other Viburnum species. For propagation of the species from seeds, the
   nearly 2-year period for seedling emergence could be shortened to 8
   months: start fresh seeds at 25/15 degrees C (60 d) and then move them
   through a sequence of 15/5 degrees C (30 d) -> 0 degrees C (120 d) ->
   20/10 degrees C (30 d).}},

   dormant. When the seeds gradually finished differentiation during warm

   extracted embryos from fresh seeds did not germinate on the basal medium
   of Murshige and Skoog medium (MS) supplemented with 3\% sucrose and

	Abstract = {{This paper considers fruit germination patterns in representatives of
   the family Sparganiaceae, which are most widespread in the European part
   of Russia: Sparganium emersum Rehm. (subgenus Xanthosparganium),
   Sparganium erectum L., and Sparganium microcarum (Neum.) Raunk.
   (subgenus Melanosparganium). It is shown that, after dissemination,
   fruits of all studied species do not germinate immediately, either
   intact or after different presowing treatment (scarification). It is
   found that under laboratory conditions a long period of moist cold
   stratification positively affects the germination ability of S. emersum
   and S. microcarpum fruits, as opposed to fruits of S. erectum. In all
   other experiments, fruits of S. microscarpum do not germinate or
   germinate sporadically. Fruits of S. erectum do not germinate,
   regardless of the different conditions of storage and presowing
   treatment. Long-term dry storage of S. emersum fruits under room
   conditions leads to a decrease in laboratory germination ability, and
   only the subsequent stratification of the fruit makes it possible to
   significantly increase this characteristic.}},

   of Phillyrea angustifolia L. and P. latifolia L. seeds in order to
   develop an optimized propagation protocol for Phillyrea species. Seeds
   of P. angustifolia and P. latifolia were collected from wild plants
   growing in Caceres province (CW Spain) and Andalucia (S Spain),

   calculated. Seeds with and without endocarp were germinated at different
   constant and alternating temperatures. Seeds without endocarp were
   soaked in distilled water or gibberellic acid, and then set to
   germinate. Seeds with endocarp of both species were stratified at 5
   degrees C for 30 or 90 days and then the endocarp was completely removed
   from the seeds before they were sowed. Chemical scarification with
   sulfuric acid and mechanical scarification were tested on P.
   angustifolia seeds with endocarp. Phillyrea endocarp was permeable to
   water, since Phillyrea seeds with endocarp imbibed water, but water
   uptake was faster when the endocarp was removed. Moreover, the encodarp
   could interfere mechanically in the emergence of the radicle, since seed
   germination of Phillyrea species was promoted by the complete removal of
   the lignified endocarp surrounding each seed. Optimal germination
   temperature for both species was 15 degrees C, and lower temperatures
   produced secondary dormancy. Soaking in distilled water or gibberellic
   acid did not significantly enhance seed germination. Cold stratification

	Abstract = {{Aim of study: We studied the germination ecology of a threatened
   daffodil in order to develop a protocol to produce plants ex-situ from
   seeds, a key tool for population reinforcement.
   Area of study: Experiments were carried out both outdoors and in the
   laboratory in Albacete (Spain).
   Material and methods: Embryo length, radicle and shoot emergence were
   analyzed to determine the level of morphophysiological dormancy (MPD).
   Effects on germination of cold stratification or desiccation in late
   stages of embryo growth were also studied.
   Main results: Mean embryo length in fresh seeds was 1.36 mm, needing to
   grow up to 2.20 mm to be able to germinate. In the laboratory, embryo
   growth occurred during warm stratification (28/14, 25/10 degrees C), and
   then radicle emerged when temperatures went down (15/4 degrees C in
   darkness). Phenology study in outdoors conditions revealed that embryo
   grew during summer-early autumn, short time after seed dispersal in
   nature (i.e., May); radicle emerged in autumn. The shoot however did not
   emerge until late winter-early spring, because it was physiologically
   dormant and required a cold (5 degrees C) period of 30 days to break
   dormancy. Early cold temperatures interrupted the embryo growth and
   induced dormancy in seeds whose embryo had grown 30\% with respect to
   the initial length. Desiccation in seeds whose embryo had grown 30\% did
   not induce dormancy, but did it when the embryo growth reached 70\%.
   Research highlights: Seeds of Narcissus radinganorum have deep simple
   epicotyl MPD.}},

@article{Cabrera2015,
	Abstract = {{Nolana (Solanaceae) is a genus composed of 88 species that inhabit arid
   and semi-arid environments throughout the Atacama Desert of Chile and
   Peru, and one from Galapagos Islands. Its greatest diversity is found in
   coastal localities, termed lomas formations, which are small isolated
   patches of vegetation sustained by the presence of low cloud layers.
   Alto Patache corresponds to one of these ecosystems, and Nolana
   jaffuelii I.M. Johnst., a summer annual herb, is the most abundant
   species in its persistent seed bank. Little is known about the seed
   germination requirements of this and other species present in Chilean
   lomas formations, despite the importance of that knowledge for taking
   appropriate conservation actions. The main objective of this study was
   to identify the germination requirements and possible dormancy
   mechanisms of N. jaffuelll's dispersal units, which are mericarps.
   Mature mericarps of N. jaffuelii were collected at Alto Patache.
   Histological analyses of cross and longitudinal sections of the
   mericarps suggested the presence of physical dormancy imposed by an
   impermeable pericarp. Different germination treatments were also
   evaluated: (T1) control, i.e., intact mericarps imbibed in water; (T2)
   intact mericarps washed under running water; (13) scarified mericarps
   (cut at the funicular scar) imbibed in water; (T4) scarified mericarps
   imbibed in gibberellic acid (500 mg l(-1) GA(3)); (T5) scarified
   mericarps imbibed in water with 2 weeks of stratification at 4 degrees
   C; and (T6) intact mericarps imbibed in GA(3). Only mericarps cut at the
   funicular scar were able to germinate, and the highest germination
   percentage was observed when the mericarps were imbibed in GA(3) (T4).
   The results of this investigation reveal the existence of physical and
   physiological dormancy in N. jaffuelii propagules, an adaptation that
   would allow this species to spend long periods waiting for favorable
   conditions for seedling establishment, which is characteristic of the
   coastal lomas formations of the Atacama Desert. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

	Abstract = {{Germination responses of Galium cracoviense Ehrend. (Rubiaceae), a
   narrow endemic species from southern Poland, were tested in light and
   dark conditions at three constant temperatures (5, 10, or 22 degrees C),
   before and after cold-wet stratification. Additionally, seeds were
   germinated under different calcium carbonate (CaCO3) concentrations (1,
   5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 mM/L CaCO3) at 22 degrees C in light. The high
   germination capacity of seeds incubated at different temperatures,
   shortly after collection, already suggested the absence of dormancy in
   this species. Thus, the seeds are ready to germinate immediately in the
   field when water resources are available and the temperature is
   adequate. Light was a significant factor for G. cracoviense; more seeds
   germinated in light than in darkness at all temperatures tested. Cold
   stratification decreased germination especially at higher temperatures.
   The light requirement for G. cracoviense germination ensures their
   successful germination on or near the soil surface, and in cracks and
   crevices in limestone, when temperature and edaphic conditions are
   favourable. Seeds of this species show temperature enforced dormancy
   throughout the winter. Germination was significantly affected by calcium
   carbonate. Non-germinated seeds germinated well after being transferred
   from higher CaCO3 concentrations to distilled water. The results
   indicate that the seeds of this species can endure CaCO3 stress without
   losing their viability and start germination once CaCO3 concentration is
   reduced. It can be concluded that the seeds of this species require
   lower Ca2+ ion concentration, moderate temperatures and the presence of
   light to germinate.}},

@article{Fernandez-Pascual15,
	Abstract = {{Background and Aims Environmental temperature regulates plant
   regeneration via seed in several superimposed ways, and this complex
   regulation will be disrupted by climate change. The role of diurnally
   alternating temperatures (Delta T) in terminating dormancy will be a
   major factor in this disruption, as its effects on seed germination are
   immediate.
   Methods The effect of Delta T on seed germination was modelled using two
   populations of the wetland sedge Carex diandra, one from a montane site
   and one from a subalpine site. A cardinal-temperature model was fitted
   to germination results obtained from a thermal gradient plate, and the
   model was used to simulate changes in germination under two possible
   future climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, for representative
   concentration pathways) as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change.
   Key Results Scenario RCP2.6 projected moderate increases in average
   temperatures and Delta T, whereas RCP8.5 projected greater warming and
   higher Delta T. Increasing Delta T decreased the base temperature for
   seed germination and the thermal time required for germination. The
   effect of higher Delta T together with the higher temperatures increased
   germination under both climate scenarios.
   Conclusions Carex diandra germination is highly responsive to potential
   changes in Delta T, and thus this study highlights the role of Delta T
   in seed responses to climate change. Comprehensive cardinal-temperature
   models, encompassing the different effects of temperature on seed
   germination, are needed to understand how climate change will affect
   plant regeneration.}},

	Abstract = {{Seed germination requirements of Viburnum lantana were investigated by
   experiments both in the laboratory and outdoors. Embryo length, radicle
   emergence and shoot emergence were analysed to determine the level of
   morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) of seeds. Mean embryo length in fresh
   seeds was 1.30 mm, and required growth to at least 2.51mm to germinate.
   The critical embryo length was 4.1 mm. In the laboratory, the embryo
   reached 3mm length after 20 weeks of warm-temperature incubation (20/7
   or 25/10 degrees C), which in fact represents a combination of warm +
   cold stratification. In seeds subjected to cold stratification (1.5 or 5
   degrees C) for 24 weeks, embryos hardly grew. Gibberellic acid
   stimulated embryo growth and germination. In the outdoor phenology test,
   the embryos grew from 1.30mm, i.e. fresh seeds sown in September, to
   2.98 mm at the end of the following March. In the `move-along' test
   (laboratory), starting with temperatures of warm stratification {[}i.e.
   25/10 degrees C (4 weeks) -> 20/7 degrees C (4 weeks) -> 15/4 degrees C
   (4 weeks) -> 5 degrees C (12 weeks) -> 15/4 degrees C (4 weeks)], and in
   the outdoor phenology study on seeds exposed to a similar temperature
   sequence, radicle emergence percentages reached 73\% after 28 and 35
   weeks, respectively. V. lantana does not exhibit a delay between root
   and shoot emergence, dismissing any kind of epicotyl dormancy. Seeds of
   V. lantana have non-deep simple MPD, a level not detected previously in
   the genus Viburnum, with the physiological dormancy component overcome
   by a combination of warm and cold stratification, preferably in that
   order.}},

	Abstract = {{Ecological (climatic and geographic) variation in early life-history
   transitions is a vital determinant of the adaptive evolution of timing
   of seed germination. This study aimed to investigate the correlation
   between timing of seed germination and environmental conditions during
   seed development. We examined seed germination timing of 15 coniferous
   seed lots of lodgepole pine, `interior' spruce and western hemlock
   collected from natural stands in British Columbia (BC), Canada, under
   manipulated {[}stratification, thermopriming (15 or 20 degrees C) and
   their combinations] and non-manipulated (control) conditions. Timing of
   seed germination showed strong and positive correlation with the
   temperature-based environmental condition during seed development. This
   pattern persisted across species and seed lots within species,
   substantiating the historic importance of environmental conditions
   during seed development and maturation to life-history traits. Moreover,
   the strategy of phenotypic plasticity affecting timing of seed
   germination was observed across the applied germination treatments.
   These results provide insight into the germination niche as affected by
   global warming, indicating that conifers' seed dormancy in BC (north of
   54 degrees N) tends to increase and the changes associated with early
   spring warm-up are expected to accelerate seedling emergence, as
   shortened winters would have a minimal effect on dormancy decay.}},

	Abstract = {{Cold stratification provided by snow cover is essential to break seed
   dormancy in many alpine plant species. The forecast reduction in snow
   precipitation and snow cover duration in most temperate mountains as a
   result of global warming could threaten alpine plant populations,
   especially those at the edge of their species distribution, by altering
   the dynamics of early life stages. We simulated some effects of a
   reduction in the snow cover period by manipulating the duration of cold
   stratification in seeds of Silene ciliata, a Mediterranean alpine
   specialist. Seeds from three populations distributed along an
   altitudinal gradient were exposed to different periods of cold
   stratification (2, 4 and 6months) in the laboratory and then moved to
   common garden conditions in a greenhouse. The duration of the cold
   stratification treatment and population origin significantly affected
   seed emergence percentage, emergence rate and seedling size, but not the
   number of seedling leaves. The 6-month and 4-month cold stratification
   treatments produced higher emergence percentages and faster emergence
   rates than seeds without cold stratification treatment. No significant
   cold stratification duration x seed population origin interactions were
   found, thus differential sensitivity to cold stratification along

	Abstract = {{Giant ragweed has become an increasingly important weed of arable land
   in many parts of North America. It is now a common weed of row crop
   production systems, a fact that can be attributed to earlier crop
   planting dates, reduced tillage, and the development of resistance to
   Group 2 and 9 herbicides. The propagation of giant ragweed seedlings for
   experimental purposes is a lengthy process because up to 90 d of
   stratification is often required to alleviate primary seed dormancy. The
   objective of this research was to evaluate physical, chemical, and cold
   stratification methods for alleviating seed dormancy in giant ragweed
   and reducing the length of cold stratification required. Results
   indicate that the most effective method for alleviating dormancy in seed
   of giant ragweed is to excise the embryo from its covering structures.
   By excising the embryo, 96\% of viable giant ragweed seeds germinated
   with no stratification. In contrast, untreated seeds required a minimum
   of 6 wk of stratification to alleviate dormancy in a similar proportion
   of the population. Although excising embryos requires time and effort,
   the time savings relative to stratification make it an attractive method
   for propagating giant ragweed seedlings.}},

   semi-arid tropics of Asia and Africa. The species is highly valuable for
   the rural populations because of its edible fruit and fodder for
   livestock. Species has immense potential for re-vegetation of degraded
   lands, as it has ability to withstand soil salinity and drought. Wild
   stands of the species are sparse which is supposed to have some kind of
   seed dormancy. Seeds of G. tenax were subjected to different
   combinations of heat and cold seed stratification treatments in two
   consecutive experiments. A positive correlation (r(2) = 0.97) was
   observed between total emergence and weeks of seed exposure to constant
   dry heat at 40 degrees C from 0 to 4 weeks. Maximum germination (70\%)
   was achieved, when seeds were exposed to dry heat at 40 degrees C for 4
   weeks as compared to control (20\%). Seeds exposed to constant heat for
   4 weeks also took only 4 and 5 days to reach 1st and 50\% emergence,
   respectively as compared to untreated seeds, which took 10 and 14 days
   to reach 1st and 50\% emergence, respectively. Moreover, emergence
   spread lasted only 4 days as compared to untreated seeds with 21 days.

	Abstract = {{Convallaria majalis has double dormancy and hypogeal germination, but no
   information is available on embryo growth or on the effects of light and

   investigated embryo growth and other germination features in seeds of
   Convallaria keiskei and compared the data with those of Trillium
   camschatcense in another study. Until now, in seeds with double
   dormancy, embryo growth and germination (epigeal) have been studied in
   detail only for seeds of Trillium camschatcense. Phenology of embryo
   growth and emergence of cotyledonary petiole/root (hereafter root) and
   shoot in seeds of Convallaria keiskei were monitored outdoors. Effects
   of temperature, light and GA(3) on embryo growth and root and shoot
   emergence were tested under laboratory conditions. Roots emerged the
   first spring following seed dispersal in autumn. The embryo grew soon
   after root emergence, and germination was hypogeal. Seeds with an
   emerged root formed buds from which a shoot (leaf) emerged above ground
   during the second spring. Alternating temperatures and light had
   negative effects on root emergence, and GA(3) did not substitute for
   cold stratification in root emergence. Seeds of Convallaria keiskei have
   double dormancy, but it differs from that in Trillium camschatcense.
   Based on differences in embryo growth before (Trillium camschatcense)
   versus after (Convallaria keiskei) root emergence, and on epigeal
   (Trillium camschatcense) versus hypogeal (Convallaria keiskei)
   germination, we suggest that two types of deep simple double
   morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) be recognized. Since embryo growth in
   Convallaria keiskei does not fit the standard definition of MPD, we
   propose to expand this definition.}},

   Hawaii 15 species occur in the montane. Our purpose was to determine if
   seeds of the Hawaiian Araliaceae species Cheirodendron trigynum subsp.
   trigynum have MD or MPD and, if MPD, what level. In a move-along
   experiment, some seeds were incubated continuously at 15/6, 20/10 or
   25/15 degrees C, while others were moved sequentially from low to high
   or from high to low temperature regimes. Germination percentages and
   embryo growth were monitored. Also, the effects of cold and warm
   stratification on dormancy break were determined. Seeds had
   physiological dormancy (PD) in addition to small embryos that grew prior
   to germination, and thus MPD. PD was broken slowly (>= 12 weeks), after
   which embryos grew rapidly, followed by root and shoot emergence.
   Embryos grew at temperatures suitable for warm stratification; thus,
   seeds have Type 1 non-deep simple MPD; the dormancy formula is C1bBb.
   Seeds from Oahu germinated to 94-100\% at 15/6, 20/10 and 25/15 degrees
   C, while those from the Big Island germinated to high percentages only
   at 15/6 and 20/10 degrees C. Temperature shifts improved germination of
   seeds from the Big Island, and movement from either low to high or from
   high to low temperature regimes was effective in promoting germination.
   This is the first report of non-deep simple MPD in the Araliaceae.}},

@article{Tuttle2015,
	Abstract = {{Knowledge about the hormonal control of grain dormancy and dormancy loss
   is essential in wheat, because low grain dormancy at maturity is
   associated with the problem of pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) when cool and
   rainy conditions occur before harvest. Low GA (gibberellin A) hormone
   sensitivity and high ABA (abscisic acid) sensitivity were associated
   with higher wheat grain dormancy and PHS tolerance. Grains of two
   PHS-tolerant cultivars were very dormant at maturity, and insensitive to
   GA stimulation of germination. More PHS-susceptible cultivars were less
   sensitive to ABA inhibition of germination, and were either more GA
   sensitive or germinated efficiently without GA at maturity. As grain
   dormancy was lost through dry afterripening or cold imbibition, grains
   first gained GA sensitivity and then lost ABA sensitivity. These changes
   in GA and ABA sensitivity can serve as landmarks defining stages of
   dormancy loss that cannot be discerned without hormone treatment. These
   dormancy stages can be used to compare different cultivars, seed lots
   and studies. Previous work showed that wheat afterripening is associated
   with decreasing ABA levels in imbibing seeds. Wheat grain dormancy loss
   through cold imbibition also led to decreased endogenous ABA levels,
   suggesting that reduced ABA signalling is a general mechanism triggering
   dormancy loss.}},

@article{Lee2015,
	Abstract = {The aims of this study were to determine the requirements for dormancy break and germination and to characterize the type of seed dormancy of T. rochebrunianum. Ripe seeds (achenes) were collected in late Sept. To determine the temperature requirements for embryo growth and germination in the field, the seeds were sown in field soil. Every 1 or 2 weeks, the seeds were exhumed, and the phenology of embryo growth, germination and seedling emergence were investigated. In the laboratory, effects of temperature and GA3 treatment on embryo growth and germination were also investigated to characterize the type of seed dormancy. Seeds had underdeveloped embryos, which were about 20{\%} of the size of those in fully matured seeds. In natural conditions, embryo growth and germination occurred in early and late March next year, respectively, and embryos in the seeds of this species had to grow to a critical length before germination was possible. Thus, the seeds had morphological dormancy (MD). When tested at the time of dispersal, few seeds germinated after 4 weeks of incubation at 25/15{\textdegree}C. Therefore, the seed dormancy type for T. rochebrunianum seemed to be morphophysiological. Embryos in the seeds grew rapidly at warm temperature conditions following cold stratification at low temperatures. After 4--12 weeks of cold stratification at 1{\textdegree}C or 5{\textdegree}C, the seeds germinated rapidly during an incubation at 25/15{\textdegree}C. Cold stratification requirements could be substituted by GA3 treatment in seeds of T. rochebrunianum. After 1000 mg{\textperiodcentered}L-1 GA3 treatment, high percentages (≥ 80{\%}) of the seeds germinated after 4 weeks of incubation at 15/6, 20/10, and 25/15{\textdegree}C. Consequently, seeds of T. rochebrunianum could be characterized as expressing non-deep simple morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). The cold stratification requirements for dormancy break enabled the seeds to produce seedlings at the beginning of the growing season in natural conditions.},

   dormancy breaking for seeds of the annual halophyte species Juncus
   ranarius were tested. Germination percentage and recovery responses of
   salt stressed seeds were also tested. Freshly collected seeds germinated
   slowly under all incubation conditions. Thus, the seeds of]. ranarius
   have physiological dormancy, e.g. they are water permeable, have a fully
   developed embryo and require cold stratification to come out of
   dormancy. Furthermore, promotion of germination by GA(3) after-ripening
   in dry storage also indicated that these seeds have non-deep
   physiological dormancy. In general, the higher the GA(3) concentration,
   the more germination occurred within the studied range. Juncus ranarius
   demonstrated a germination preference for light. The highest germination
   percentage and rate of germination were recorded under constant light
   conditions at 22 degrees C after 24 weeks of cold stratification. In
   saline solutions, the highest percentage of germination was obtained at
   25 mM L-1 NaCl, and further increase in salinity resulted in a gradual
   decrease in germination. However, ungerminated seeds were not damaged by
   salt, showing a high level of recovery. The greater the reduction in
   salinity, the better the germination rate became. It was concluded that
   dormancy could be completely broken by cold stratification, indicating
   spring germination. Juncus ranarius can grow well at lower NaCl

	Abstract = {{Germination is considered one of the important phenological stages that
   are influenced by environmental factors, with timing and abundance
   determining plant establishment and recruitment. This study investigates
   the influence of temperature, soil moisture and light on the germination
   phenology of six Eucalyptus species from two co-occurring groups of
   three species representing warm-dry and cool-moist sclerophyll forests.
   Data from germination experiments were used to calibrate the germination
   module of the mechanistic model TACA-GEM, to evaluate germination
   phenology under a range of climate change scenarios. With the exception
   of E. polyanthemos, the optimal niche for all species was characterised
   by cool-moist stratification, low light, cool temperatures and high soil
   moisture. Model results indicated that of the warm-dry species,
   Eucalyptus microcarpa exhibited greater germination and establishment
   under projected changes of warmer drier conditions than its co-occurring
   species Eucalyptus polyanthemos and Eucalyptus tricarpa which suggests
   that E. microcarpa could maintain its current distribution under a
   warmer and drier climate in southeastern Australia. Among the cool-moist
   species, Eucalyptus radiata was the only species that established under
   projected climate change of the 2080s but at such a low probability that
   its persistence compared to Eucalyptus obliqua and Eucalyptus sieberi
   cannot be posited. For all cool-moist species, germination did not
   benefit from the phenological shifts they displayed. This study
   successfully demonstrated environmental effects on germination phenology
   and how a shift in climate can influence the timing and success of
   recruitment.}},

	Abstract = {{Knowledge of processes responsible for seed dormancy can improve our
   understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of reproductive systems. We
   examined the influence of the breeding system on primary seed dormancy
   in Hypericum elodes, an Atlantic-European softwater pools specialist
   plant that exhibits a mixed mating strategy (the ability to both self-
   and cross-pollinate) to set seeds. Seeds were obtained through hand
   pollination treatments performed in a natural population during three
   consecutive years. Primary dormancy of seeds recovered from each
   pollination treatment was measured by analysing the seed germination
   response at dispersal and after various periods of cold stratification.
   While all collected seeds exhibited physiological dormancy, the degree
   of primary dormancy was associated with the pollination treatments. Weak
   and rapid loss of primary dormancy characterized seeds recovered from
   self-pollinated flowers, while stronger dormancy was found in seeds
   obtained from cross-pollination. The association between pollination
   treatments and primary dormancy indicated that the mating system should
   be considered as a source of variation for dormancy degree, proportional
   to self- and cross-pollinations (selfing rate) within populations of
   this species. These results suggest that by shedding seeds with various
   degrees of dormancy, plants may distribute their offspring across time
   by means of polymorphism in germination response. We conclude that seed
   germination alone is not an appropriate fitness measure for inbreeding
   depression estimates, unless dormancy is removed.}},

	Abstract = {{Glebionis coronaria (L.) Cass. ex Spach is a common Mediterranean weed
   producing distinctive central and peripheral dormant cypselae with a
   hard fruit coat, which was previously hypothesized to impose physical
   dormancy. Analysis of water uptake in cypselae and in naked seeds showed
   that it preferentially takes place at the basal end of the fruit;
   however, seeds within an intact pericarp do not fully imbibe when
   compared with naked seeds. Germination was not significantly different
   between the two heteromorphs, and afterripening or cold stratification
   did not increase germination, while warm stratification at 35/20 degrees
   C, as revealed by logistic regression, resulted in a significant
   improvement. However, loss of viability was also rapid at these high
   temperatures. Central and peripheral cypselae generally showed very low
   germination. In both heteromorphs, faster and higher germination
   (60-70\%) was reached only after extensive scarification of pericarp
   tissue, and full germination was observed only after complete removal of
   pericarp tissue. Although the pericarp significantly reduced water
   uptake, no palisade layer(s) of macrosclereids could be observed.
   Xylem-vessel elements were found running through the basal end of the
   pericarp and forming the main point of water entry. We reject the
   hypothesis that G. coronaria cypselae have physical dormancy. Instead,
   water uptake and germination are impeded by: (1) directed water uptake,
   mainly through a pericarp-spanning channel-like structure; and (2)
   mechanical constraint on embryo growth exerted by the hard pericarp. The
   channel-like structure forms the principal system for controlling seed
   germination.}},

   species of polar vascular plants, Cerastium alpinum, Colobanthus
   quitensis, Silene involucrata, Deschampsia antarctica and Poa annua,
   indicates that optimal temperature conditions for seed germination have
   never been identified for some of them, and the results reported for the
   remaining species are largely inconclusive. Our results and published
   findings suggest that significant differences in the germinability of
   the analysed five species and their species-specific germination
   responses to temperature and cold stratification could result from
   variations in their physiological dormancy levels. It is important that
   seed physiological development at time of collection, seed storing time
   and conditions are as equal as possible when comparing results from
   different studies. Our study revealed differences in the maximum
   germination percentages of those species, which ranged from very low (C.
   alpinum, 10 \%) to very high (S. involucrata, 99 \%). Silene
   involucrata, C. quitensis and D. antarctica have fast-germinating seeds,
   whereas P. annua is a long germinating species. Within the range of four
   tested temperatures (12, 20, 20/7 and 30/20 A degrees C), the lowest
   germination percentage of S. involucrata seeds was observed at
   fluctuating temperature of 30/20 A degrees C and C. quitensis seeds at
   12 A degrees C, the highest germination percentage of C. quitensis seeds
   was reported at fluctuating temperature of 20/7 A degrees C and P. annua
   seeds at 12 A degrees C, whereas the germination percentage of D.
   antarctica was not affected by temperature. A two-month cold
   stratification period stimulated germination in C. quitensis and D.
   antarctica, but it did not affect the germination of C. alpinum.}},

@article{Hoyle2015,
	Abstract = {{1. Seed germination strategies vary dramatically among species but
   relatively little is known about how germination traits correlate with
   other elements of plant strategy systems. Understanding drivers of
   germination strategy is critical to our understanding of the
   evolutionary biology of plant reproduction.
   2. We present a novel assessment of seed germination strategies
   focussing on Australian alpine species as a case study. We describe the
   distribution of germination strategies and ask whether these are
   correlated with, or form an independent axis to, other plant functional
   traits. Our approach to describing germination strategy mimicked
   realistic temperatures that seeds experience in situ following
   dispersal. Strategies were subsequently assigned using an objective
   clustering approach. We hypothesized that two main strategies would
   emerge, involving dormant or non-dormant seeds, and that while these
   strategies would be correlated with seed traits (e.g., mass or
   endospermy) they would be largely independent of vegetative traits when
   analysed in a phylogenetically structured manner.
   3. Across all species, three germination strategies emerged. The
   majority of species postponed germination until after a period of cold,
   winter-like temperatures indicating physiological and/or morphological
   dormancy mechanisms. Other species exhibited immediate germination at
   temperatures representative of those at dispersal. Interestingly, seeds
   of an additional 13 species ``staggered{''} germination over time.
   Germination strategies were generally conserved within families. Across
   a broad range of ecological traits only seed mass and endospermy showed
   any correlation with germination strategy when phylogenetic relatedness
   was accounted for; vegetative traits showed no significant correlations
   with germination strategy. The results indicate that germination traits
   correlate with other aspects of seed ecology but form an independent
   axis relative to vegetative traits.}},

   The objective of this study was to evaluate different techniques to
   overcome the dormancy of pecan seeds and the subsequent development of
   seedlings testing four different methods. In the control treatments, the
   seeds remained in a protected environment with no treatment. In the
   method with scarification, seeds were sanded in the apical part at the
   time of sowing and stratification. Then, seeds were accommodated in
   boxes with moist sand and subsequently kept at 4 degrees C.
   Additionally, scarification and stratification methods were tested
   simultaneously. Treatments consisted of 10 repetitions of three seeds
   each. After each period (30, 60 and 90 days), seeds were sown in trays
   containing Mecplant (R) substrate and maintained at 25 degrees C +/- 2
   degrees C, photoperiod of 12 h. Shoot height, stem diameter, number of
   leaves, total emergency, emergency speed index, dry biomass, leaf area

@article{Liu2016,
	Abstract = {{Background: Seeds use environmental cues such as temperature to
   coordinate the timing of their germination, allowing plants to
   synchronize their life history with the seasons. Winter chilling is of
   central importance to alleviate seed dormancy, but very little is known
   of how chilling responses are regulated in conifer seeds. White spruce
   (Picea glauca) is an important conifer species of boreal forests in the
   North American taiga. The recent sequencing and assembly of the white
   spruce genome allows for comparative gene expression studies toward
   elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing dormancy alleviation by
   moist chilling. Here we focused on hormone metabolite profiling and
   analyses of genes encoding components of hormone signal transduction
   pathways, to elucidate changes during dormancy alleviation and to help
   address how germination cues such as temperature and light trigger
   radicle emergence.
   Results: ABA, GA, and auxin underwent considerable changes as seeds
   underwent moist chilling and during subsequent germination; likewise,
   transcripts encoding hormone-signaling components (e.g. ABI3, ARF4 and
   Aux/IAA) were differentially regulated during these critical stages.
   During moist chilling, active IAA was maintained at constant levels, but
   IAA conjugates (IAA-Asp and IAA-Glu) were substantially accumulated. ABA
   concentrations decreased during germination of previously moist-chilled
   seeds, while the precursor of bioactive GA1 (GA53) accumulated. We
   contend that seed dormancy and germination may be partly mediated
   through the changing hormone concentrations and a modulation of
   interactions between central auxin-signaling pathway components
   (TIR1/AFB, Aux/IAA and ARF4). In response to germination cues, namely
   exposure to light and to increased temperature: the transfer of seeds
   from moist-chilling to 30 degrees C, significant changes in gene
   transcripts and protein expression occurred during the first six hours,
   substantiating a very swift reaction to germination-promoting conditions
   after seeds had received sufficient exposure to the chilling stimulus.
   Conclusions: The dormancy to germination transition in white spruce
   seeds was correlated with changes in auxin conjugation, auxin signaling
   components, and potential interactions between auxin-ABA signaling
   cascades (e.g. the transcription factor ARF4 and ABI3). Auxin flux adds
   a new dimension to the ABA: GA balance mechanism that underlies both
   dormancy alleviation by chilling, and subsequent radicle emergence to
   complete germination by warm temperature and light stimuli.}},

   stratification and burial treatment for overcoming the seed dormancy of
   D. giraldii. Results showed that chemical pre-treatment was less
   effective in breaking dormancy. The best germination percentage (G(P))
   was 52.33 \%, a germination rate (G(R)) of 1.19 only observed after 70 d
   of seed stratification at 5 degrees C treatment, indicating that the
   germination behavior of D. giraldii was not significantly affected by
   stratification. The physiological dormancy of D. giraldii seeds was
   alleviated during burial. Seeds buried at 100 cm depth for 170 days
   showed the highest germination success with G(P) of 86.5 \% and G(R) of
   10.11, which was the most effective treatment to alleviate seed

	Abstract = {Seed dormancy is an adaptive trait that widely exists in angiosperms and gymnosperms. The mechanisms for the release of seed dormancy have been less well studied. Using smoke tree (Cotinus coggygria var. Cinerea Engler) seeds, the effect of cold moist stratification (5 {\textdegree}C, 18.5 {\%} humidity and 0--75 days) on dormancy release, changes of respiration rate, ABA and GA3 content, and the differentially expressed proteins during dormancy release were investigated. Seed dormancy was released during cold moist stratification, seed respiration rate was increased while both ABA and GA3 concentrations were decreased. A total of 28 protein spots with significant changes in relative expression abundance were detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Among these protein spots, four proteins of ATPase $\beta$ subunit, heat-shock cognate protein 70, aspartic proteinase 1 and actin were successfully identified by the matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. These four proteins were all down-expressed during dormancy release, and their possible implications for dormancy release of C. coggygria seeds was discussed. A better understanding of seed dormancy release and germination has practical benefits to seedling production for forest regeneration purposes.},

In addition, we investigated how the different parts of the seed contributed to dormancy and intraspecific variability. S. phleoides has non-deep physiological dormancy that appeared to be related to its testa. Thereby, dormancy was completely removed with puncturing treatments. High levels of germination were also obtained in seeds stratified at 8$\,^{\circ}$C over 100 days in a solution of nitrates. After-ripening treatment did not have a significant effect in breaking dormancy. Similar germination behaviour and dormancy levels were observed in the different populations, especially when they were subjected to cold stratification. Although further work is needed, cold stratification appears to be the major factor in determining the time of seedling establishment in natural environments for this species.},

	Abstract = {{Some Rubus species are slow to germinate due to their thick, impermeable

   scarification and stratification on the breaking of dormancy in five
   Rubus species (R. parvifolius, R. phoenicolasius, R. buergeri, R.
   takesimensis and R. corchorifolius). On anatomical observation, Rubus
   stones are generally shown to have a three-layered endocarp (outer-,
   middle-, and inner-endocarp) that conveys physical dormancy. For the
   scarification treatment, stones were treated with sulphuric acid. The
   most effective treatment for breaking dormancy resulted in 50-70\%
   scarification of the middle-endocarp. The combined treatment of
   scarification and stratification considerably increased germination of
   Rubus seeds. In particular, sulphuric acid scarification followed by
   cold stratification (eight weeks at 4 degrees C) was most effective for
   three species: R. parvifolius, R. phoenicolasius and R. takesimensis.
   However, R. corchorifolius showed very similar results in all
   stratification treatments and R. buergeri was affected by neither single
   nor combined scarification and stratification treatments. In summary,
   three of the studied species of Rubus were found to exhibit deep
   combinational dormancy caused by a hard endocarp and physiological
   inhibitory mechanisms. In contrast, R. corchorifolius seeds only showed
   physical dormancy.}},

	Abstract = {{In this study, three putative plant growth promoting rhizobacteria
   (PGPR) including Pseudomonas putida strain 168, Bacillus subtilis strain
   FzB24 and Enterobacter cloacae strain 12, were applied as single and
   combination of three strains for their ability to improve seed
   germination traits and early growth in three Corylus avellana ecotypes.
   After inclusion, seeds were sown in 45 cmx20 cmx10 cm plastic containers
   filled with wet sterilized river sand and subjected to cold
   stratification (CS) in a refrigerator at (5 +/- 1 degrees C) for 0, 3
   and 4 months. The experiment was done based on factorial in a completely
   randomized design with 3 replicates of 20 seeds each. The numbers of
   germinated seeds were recorded daily for each ecotype. At the end of the
   experiment, germination percentage (GP), germination speed (GS), seed
   vigor index (SVI) of the seeds were calculated. Results showed that, CS,
   ecotypes, bacteria inoculation and interactions of these factors
   affected germination traits. Over all treatments, GP ranged from 1.66\%
   to 65.40\% among the ecotypes. Both CS and inoculation had positive
   effect on GP. The greatest GP (61.35-65.40\%) and onset of germination
   occurred in seeds co-inoculated by the combination of 3 bacterial
   inoculants followed by 4 months CS. Among ecotypes, the highest SVI
   (160.77) belonged to seeds of Makesh ecotype inoculated by the
   combination of 3 bacterial inoculants full in some points owed by 4
   months CS. In case of application of bacterial as individual, the
   highest germination traits and early growth were obtained in seeds
   inoculated with Pseudomonas putida. The findings confirm that PGPR is
   better to be used in combination with cold stratification to overcome
   seed dormancy, improvement of seed germination treats and early growth
   of C. avellana.}},

	Abstract = {Stratification is the exposure of seeds to conditions which break dormancy and enhance germination. Currently stratification is limited to abiotic conditions such as cold, acidity, light, salinity and osmotic priming. Here, the role of biological stratification on mycovitality was uncovered by assessing the effect of fungal endosymbiont on its host plant during dormancy release and germination commencement in seeds. The impact of the endophytic fungal SMCD 2206 strain on germination energy and vigor as compared to untreated seeds was evaluated. The expression patterns of plant growth promoting genes, repression of shoot growth (RSG) protein and ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO) of gibberellins (GAs), during the early breakage of seed dormancy and germination were assessed and indicated the involvement of a GA-mediated negative feedback regulation in treated seeds. The GA levels in all treated seeds reached optimum before 24 h of germination with direct interactions between seeds and endophyte generating maximum GA levels during the early germination stage. Our findings bring a significant contribution to plant prenatal care of cereal crops; they demonstrate endophyte-mediated vitality, a reprogramming of pre- and post-germination events in wheat seeds, which enhances dormancy breakage and germination.},

	Abstract = {Reduced seed germination is among the most important factors adversely affecting crop stand and subsequent plant growth. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill) is an important medicinal plant with poor seed germination rate, occasionally. It is accordingly pertinent to find methods which can enhance fennel seed germination and remove the barriers of dormancy breaking. The present experiments studied the effects of two different priming (cold moist stratification and osmopriming) and 14 dormancy breaking techniques (hormonal, osmopriming, biopriming, chemical priming, and hydropriming) on the seed germination and seedling growth of two different fennel genotypes under growth chamber conditions. In the first and second experiment, the priming techniques including the time lengths of cold moist stratification (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) and the concentrations of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000, osmopriming at −0.99, −1.35, and −2.33 MPa) were used as the main plots. However, in both experiments, the dormancy breaking techniques and fennel genotypes were factorially combined and used as the subplots. Different seed- and seedling-related parameters including germination ({\%}), plumule, radicle and seedling length, average germination time, rate and homogeneity of germination, and seed vigor index were determined. Both priming techniques were efficient on the enhancement of seed germination and seedling growth. Among the dormancy breaking techniques, Aminol Forte (biopriming), kadostim (biopriming), benzyl adenine{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}kinetin (biopriming), distilled water (hydropriming), gibberellin{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}kinetin (hormonal priming), and benzyl adenine{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}kinetin{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}gibberellin (biopriming) were the most effective ones. The related concentrations were equal to 100 mg/l, 10−5 M, and 0.4 {\%}. The fennel genotypes reacted significantly different under priming conditions. It is possible to enhance seed germination and seedling growth of fennel using priming and dormancy breaking techniques, which is useful for the increased production of fennel under different conditions. The results indicate that bio and hydropriming techniques were among the most effective ones, which significantly increased seed germination and seedling growth, and removed the seed dormancy barriers.},

	Abstract = {Dormancy in Juniperus polycarpos (K. Koch) seeds is a major hurdle for production of the desired quantity of seedlings in nurseries for restoration purpose. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an optimal dormancy breaking treatment and subsequent stimulation of germination. The treatments applied were cold stratification at 1 {\textdegree}C for 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks; warm stratification at 20 {\textdegree}C for 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks followed by 12 weeks of cold stratification; exogenous application of 250, 500, and 1000 ppm gibberellic acid (GA3) and 6-Benzylamino purine (BAP); and a combination of 500 ppm hormones and cold stratification. The results show significant differences in germination between cold and warm-cold stratification, length of stratification and their interaction (p < 0.01). Warm stratification for 16 weeks followed by 12 weeks of cold stratification induced 72 {\%} of the seeds to germination in 12 days compared with 16-week cold-stratification alone (42 {\%}) and the control (8 {\%}). Exogenous application of GA3 and BAP alone or in combination with cold stratification resulted in less than 50 {\%} germination though significantly (p < 0.01) higher than the control. Apparently, the hormone treatments alone or in combination with cold stratification are not effective in completely breaking dormancy and stimulation of germination. The findings suggest that J. polycarpos seeds may possess intermediate simple morpho-physiological dormancy, which could be an adaptive mechanism for relatively warmer autumn temperature during seed maturation and the subsequent cold winter temperature under natural conditions.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Threshold‐based thermal time models provide insight into the physiological switch from the dormant to the non‐dormant germinating seed. This approach was used to quantify the different growth responses of the embryo of seeds purported to have morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) through the complex phases of dormancy release and germination. Aquilegia barbaricina seeds were incubated at constant temperatures (10--25 $\,^{\circ}$C) and 25/10 $\,^{\circ}$C, without pre‐treatment, after warm+cold stratification (W+C) and GA3 treatment. Embryo growth was assessed and the time of testa and endosperm rupture scored. Base temperatures (Tb) and thermal times for 50\% (θ50) of embryo growth and seed germination were calculated. W+C enabled slow embryo growth. W+C and GA3 promoted rapid embryo growth and subsequent radicle emergence. The embryo internal growth base temperature (Tbe) was ca. 5 $\,^{\circ}$C for W+C and GA3‐treated seeds. GA3 treatment also resulted in similar Tb estimates for radicle emergence. The thermal times for embryo growth (θe50) and germination (θg50) were four‐ to six‐fold longer in the presence of GA3 compared to W+C. A. barbaricina is characterised by a multi‐step seed germination. The slow embryo growth during W+C reflects continuation of the maternal programme of development, whilst the thermal kinetics of both embryo and radicle growth after the removal of physiological dormancy are distinctly different. The effects of W+C on the multiphasic germination response in MPD seeds are only partially mimicked by 250 mg·l−1 GA3. The thermal time approach could be a valid tool to model thermal kinetics of embryo growth and radicle protrusion.},

@article{Blossey2017,
	Abstract = {Summary Local differences in climate conditions may facilitate rapid evolutionary changes in introduced plants to optimize timing of germination or ability to survive in seed banks, which may constitute beneficial demographic adaptations during range expansions. Understanding differences in germination requirements and emergence patterns across a species' range is critical for demographic modelling and potential invasive species control efforts. We assessed germination responses of Alliaria petiolata using seeds collected from 10 populations spanning much of the North American distribution of the species. We compared germination responses under different stratification regimes in a growth chamber over 2·5 years, and evaluated seedling emergence in a common garden in Ithaca, New York over 13 years. We further evaluated how climate overlap between Ithaca and original collection sites influenced emergence patterns. In the laboratory, germination of all populations was similar and highest at 4 $\,^{\circ}$C stratification. Seeds exposed to sub‐zero temperatures delayed germination and population responses were variable. In the common garden, seedlings from most populations emerged over 13 years, and emergence patterns were strongly influenced by population. Annual emergence was positively correlated with spring temperature and inversely correlated with number of spring days with minimum temperature below freezing. Climate overlap between the common garden and original collection location enhanced germination, but common garden climate conditions over the course of the 13‐year experiment and population identity had greater explanatory power. Synthesis. Laboratory germination tests did not reflect seedling emergence under field conditions. After 150 years of residence time in North America, Alliaria petiolata populations have developed striking differences in their responses to local climates and stratification requirements suggesting that a complex interplay of pre‐adaptation, rapid evolutionary changes, and phenotypic plasticity result in locally adapted populations.},

@article{Seglias:2018aa,
	Abstract = {For many species and seed sources used in restoration activities, specific seed germination requirements are often unknown. Because seed dormancy and germination traits can be constrained by phylogenetic history, related species are often assumed to have similar traits. However, significant variation in these traits is also present within species as a result of adaptation to local climatic conditions. A growing number of studies have attempted to disentangle how phylogeny and climate influence seed dormancy and germination traits, but they have focused primarily on species-level effects, ignoring potential population-level variation. We examined the relationships between phylogeny, climate, and seed dormancy and germination traits for 24 populations of eight native, restoration-relevant forb species found in a wide range of climatic conditions in the Southwest United States. The seeds were exposed to eight temperature and stratification length regimes designed to mimic regional climatic conditions. Phylogenetic relatedness, overall climatic conditions, and temperature conditions at the site were all significantly correlated with final germination response, with significant among-population variation in germination response across incubation treatments for seven of our eight study species. Notably, germination during stratification was significantly predicted by precipitation seasonality and differed significantly among populations for seven species. While previous studies have not examined germination during stratification as a potential trait influencing overall germination response, our results suggest that this trait should be included in germination studies as well as seed sourcing decisions. Results of this study deepen our understanding of the relationships between source climate, species identity, and germination, leading to improved seed sourcing decisions for restorations.},

	Abstract = {Despite the strong environmental control of seed dormancy and longevity, their changes along latitudes are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to assess seed dormancy and longevity in different populations across the distribution of the arctic--alpine plant Silene suecica. Seeds of seven populations collected from alpine (Spain, Italy, Scotland) and subarctic (Sweden, Norway) populations were incubated at four temperature regimes and five cold stratification intervals for germination and dormancy testing. Seed longevity was studied by exposing seeds to controlled ageing (45 {\textdegree}C, 60{\%} RH) and regularly sampled for germination. Fresh seeds of S. suecica germinated at warm temperature (20/15 {\textdegree}C) and more in subarctic (80--100{\%}) compared to alpine (20--50{\%}) populations showed a negative correlation with autumn temperature (i.e., post-dispersal period). Seed germination increased after cold stratification in all populations, with different percentages (30--100{\%}). Similarly, there was a large variation of seed longevity (p50 = 12--32 days), with seeds from the wettest locations showing faster deterioration rate. Subarctic populations of S. suecica were less dormant, showing a warmer suitable temperature range for germination, and a higher germinability than alpine populations. Germination and dormancy were driven by an interplay of geographical and climatic factors, with alpine and warm versus subarctic and cool autumn conditions, eliciting a decrease and an increase of emergence, respectively. Germination and dormancy patterns typically found in alpine habitats may not be found in the arctic.},
